I am curious what the learners give back today again:
yesterday there was no unambiguous feedback for Lars,
where there were some clearly for me only.
And I've listened, as can be seen in my lesson plans.
It heavily improved my lessons!

Before teaching, I already see that there are 17 branches
and 13 Pull Requests. Bj√∂rn did a great job there!

## During teaching

I predict that getting VS Code to use tests is a thing
mentioned at the Retrospect.
