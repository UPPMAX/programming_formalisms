# Reflection

Yesterday, I felt bad because I could not help as good as I could.
This was because **I** did not know what the learners needed to do.
I hope next time, the exercises are clear enough for me to be able
to help.

## First half

I started with issues, kanban board and developer experience.
I talk until 10:42, then sent the learners to rooms in duos.
I could see the issues come in and saw things happening at the
kanban board. 
I checked the rooms regularily.
I think this was a good enough session.

The TDD part started explaining why it is important,
how the exercise needs to be done and I put the
learners in seperate rooms at 11:22.
I checked rooms regularily and had 4x a question.
At 13:00 I will do a demo together with a learner,
to show the full workflow. 
I think I have found a great
volunteer to do TDD with.

I think the order was incorrect:

- [ ] First discuss `assert`

I wanted to do TDD first, because I feel that learners need 
a lot of time to read in peace and quiet. Because I felt the pressure
of the limited schedule, I probably put TDD in a too early slot.
