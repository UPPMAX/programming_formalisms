# Reflection

I was happy to be with the learners, but too tired to
enjoy it. I did not like talking so much: I'd prefer
to have have done an exercise instead. I decided to go through the
theory, but I could have re-organize the content,
making it more exercise focussed. 

- [ ] Make more exercise-focussed

I also could have done better: the speed optimization misconceptions
could be done in small groups and discussed.

Also, the references
to the literature are too diffuse/sprinked:
I want to see big lists everywhere :-)

- [ ] Copy refs

Also, I am unconvinced about the use of Big O in its current
form: it should have been about predictions.
It should be scheduled after run-time speed optimization.

- [ ] Schedule big O after run-time speed optimization

I predicted I would be tired at the end of the course and I predicted
these would be my worst lectures, as I felt the same in earlier
iterations of the course.

## Whole course

I feel I did a reasonable job.
We all (teachers and learners) helped create a warm atmosphere in the course.

My favorite improvement was my exercises: thanks to the Retrospect at day 1,
I suddenly understood what was needed. 'No plan surives first contact with
the enemy', they say, for me it was more that the retrospect made me
prioritize better. 

I would now say that a good exercise is:

- Clearly described what to do
- Has a worked-out solution
- If possible: has multiple skill levels

I want to have this in all my exercises, before next course iteration.

- [ ] Make all exercises like that

I enjoyed the team of teachers. My favorite is how we can flat-out
disagree, without any drama.

The course is a complex beast, with many dependencies between lessons.
I wonder why we do not have written a script to check if our schedule holds?

- [ ] Make stub of script, to be used in CI

I've added domain-specific knowledge, in the form of biology.
I think it should be general things we have exercises of

- [ ] Remove biology things

I think the project should be worked on more and be simplified.
Maybe start with a proper/pre-fab requirements list.
Branch of from the main function more.
