I was happy to be with the learners, but too tired to
enjoy it. I did not like talking so much: I'd prefer
to have have done an exercise instead. I decided to go through the
theory, but I could have re-organize the content,
making it more exercise focussed. 

- [ ] Make more exercise-focussed

I also could have done better: the speed optimization misconceptions
could be done in small groups and discussed.

Also, the references
to the literature are too diffuse/sprinked:
I want to see big lists everywhere :-)

- [ ] Copy refs

Also, I am unconvinced about the use of Big O in its current
form: it should have been about predictions.
It should be scheduled after run-time speed optimization.

- [ ] Schedule big O after run-time speed optimization

I predicted I would be tired at the end of the course and I predicted
these would be my worst lectures, as I felt the same in earlier
iterations of the course.
