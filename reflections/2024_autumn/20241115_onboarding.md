# Onboarding

I predict few learners, max 5 in total, with most arriving before 9:30.
I predict 1 teacher is enough. Let's see...

`t` |`n`|Events
----|---|--------------
8:52|1  |A joined, no talk
8:53|0  |A left
9:54|0  |.
9:00|0  |.
9:03|1  |B joined, talk with B
9:04|2  |C joined
9:05|1  |B left to work in silence and will come back with questions
9:06|1  |C in breakout room with BC
9:07|1  |.
9:15|1  |B back for a question
9:16|1  |C done and left
9:17|1  |B leaves room to work in silence
9:19|0  |.
9:21|0  |.
9:22|1  |D comes in, leaves
9:23|0  |.
9:28|0  |.


- Names of learners are pseudonimized to A, B, C, etc.
- Names of teachers are the standard abbreviations: BC, LE, RB
- `t`: time
- `n`: number of learners
- max amount of learners: 2
- amount of teachers that would have sufficed: 1
- Use `r` as number of registrations where `R` is 20
- Prediction that would be correct:
    - Amount of learners to expect: `r / 5`
    - Amount of learners to have questions: `r / 10`
    - Amount of learners to pop in and out: `r / 10`
    - Amount of teachers needed: `r / 20`
