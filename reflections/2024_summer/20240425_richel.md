# Reflection 2024-02-25 Day 4 by Richel

## Preparation

'Pingpong pair programming' is a term I should mention again.

Added 'GitHub Issues and Project', it could be used earlier.

## During

### Hour 1

All members of all three groups have committed on the group branch.

I felt this (third) hour (of TDD) was useful and should have been done earlier.

- [ ] Next iteration: schedule 4 hours of TDD

### Hour 2

I put in more time for individual reading in silence.
One learner put this in a Retrospective and I was eager to 
try it out. This session has 10 minutes to read in silence, during which
I will not disturb either (hence time to work on this reflection :-) ).

### Hour 3

I forgot to do a Prior.

I had no material, but I think I improvised well enough. 
Instead of lecturing, discussions in BO rooms is superior :-)

### Hour 4

I really enjoy our learners **finally** being able to do
what they should have been taught earlier.
Due to this, next hour will also be working on Issues...

### Hour 5

I struggled how to do code reviews. Now we let the learners
fake it. Ideally, it should be me or a helper.
Next time, schedule a helper to do code reviews.

- [ ] Next iteration, schedule a helper to do code reviews.
