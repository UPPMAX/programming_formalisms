# Reflection 2024-02-23 Day 2 by Richel

Looking at the course material I see things that add fluff
to the course in my opinion.

```
Only discuss theory that ...

- is (and can be) checked by an exercise
- is needed for the shared project

When in doubt, remove.
```

- creating an own local GitHub repo: not needed for shared project
- Forking: not needed for shared project

I add to the rule:

```
Only discuss theory that ...

- is (and can be) checked by an exercise
- is needed for the shared project

When in doubt, remove.

If there are two ways to do something,
pick the way which involves the least amount of new concepts.
```

- `git init`: not needed for shared project, can be done on GitHub
- `git branch -c`: can be done on GitHub
- `git graph`: can be done on GitHub
- `git diff`: can be done on GitHub
- `git show`: no exercise
- `git log`: no exercise, can be done on GitHub
- `git mv`: no exercise
- `git rm`: no exercise
- big code examples: can be simplified to a 'Hello world' program
- use multiple files: can be simplified to one file
- use big files: can be simplified to short files
- use complex commit graphs: can be simplified to simple commit graphs
- using more repos: can be simplified to only use the shared repo
- using git plugin: can be simplified by using GitHub view
- using GitHub templates: not needed for shared project
- using protected branches: not needed for shared project
- add using Issues: we do use these in the shared project!
- using command-line: if possible with GitHub

I add to the rule some green and red flags

```

pick the way which involves the least amount of new concepts.

Green flags:
- 'You need this'

Red flags:
- 'maybe this is useful'
- 'if you have the time, you may want to take a look at ...'
```


- [x] Settle on `git switch` and `git checkout`: which one is better?
  `git checkout` as there was one learner that could not use the
  alternative, as he had an older git version

Regarding my teaching:

- I am happy with how it went: I spoke little, 
  I think I never spoke longer than 20 minutes,
  adapted to the needs/pace of the learners,
  had interactions with all of them,
  with some minor teaching in the BO rooms.
  I think the exercises were clear, as never was I asked for clarification.
- Even though I have a lot of time for exercises, 
  it still feels to short. 
  I wish earlier in the course, the learners had already practiced basic
  git things such as merging; I had to adapt to what the learners could do
- Judging from the git commits, I see the pair programming and TDD
  has watered down. I will need to practice this tomorrow again

- [ ] Next course iteration, schedule 3 hours for TDD
