# Reflection 2024-02-23 Day 2 by Richel

Looking at the course material I see things that add fluff
to the course in my opinion.

```
Only discuss theory that ...

- is (and can be) checked by an exercise
- is needed for the shared project

When in doubt, remove.
```

- creating an own local GitHub repo: not needed for shared project
- Forking: not needed for shared project

I add to the rule:

```
Only discuss theory that ...

- is (and can be) checked by an exercise
- is needed for the shared project

When in doubt, remove.

If there are two ways to do something,
pick the way which involves the least amount of new concepts.
```

- `git init`: not needed for shared project, can be done on GitHub
- `git branch -c`: can be done on GitHub
- big code examples: can be simplified to a 'Hello world' program



- [ ] Settle on `git switch` and `git checkout`: which one is better?
