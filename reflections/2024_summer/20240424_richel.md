# Reflection 2024-02-23 Day 2 by Richel

Looking at the course material I see things that add fluff
to the course in my opinion.

```
Only discuss theory that ...

- is (and can be) checked by an exercise
- is needed for the shared project

When in doubt, remove.
```

- creating an own local GitHub repo: not needed for shared project
- Forking: not needed for shared project

I add to the rule:

```
Only discuss theory that ...

- is (and can be) checked by an exercise
- is needed for the shared project

When in doubt, remove.

If there are two ways to do something,
pick the way which involves the least amount of new concepts.
```

- `git init`: not needed for shared project, can be done on GitHub
- `git branch -c`: can be done on GitHub
- `git graph`: can be done on GitHub
- `git diff`: can be done on GitHub
- `git show`: no exercise
- `git log`: no exercise
- `git mv`: no exercise
- `git rm`: no exercise
- big code examples: can be simplified to a 'Hello world' program
- use multiple files: can be simplified to one file
- use big files: can be simplified to short files
- use complex commit graphs: can be simplified to simple commit graphs
- using more repos: can be simplified to only use the shared repo
- using git plugin: can be simplified by using GitHub view
- using GitHub templates: not needed for shared project


- [ ] Settle on `git switch` and `git checkout`: which one is better?
