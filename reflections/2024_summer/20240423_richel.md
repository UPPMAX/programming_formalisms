# Reflection 2024-02-23 Day 2 by Richel

This was the schedule taken from my lesson plan:

When          |What              |Status
--------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------
TU 13:00-14:00|Pair programming 1|Draft of content, draft of exercises
TU 14:00-14:45|Pair programming 2|Draft of content, draft of exercises
TU 15:00-15:45|TDD 1             |[1] Draft of content, draft of exercises

I started at 13:00 sharp with 7 students. There would be 2 more learners
in a couple of minutes. I started by showing the 'Who is Richel'
presentation on my `teaching` repo. I think it is dull, yet it felt useful 
enough. I asked for questions and I did get one, that I rejected, as
it was unrelated to teaching. I regret that I had to reject it,
so next time I will ask 'Are there question on this way of teaching?',
as this is more precisely what I mean.

I felt it would be a good to start with a course overview,
to remind the learners of the big picture. 
This felt useful.

The pair programming session started with a literature read.
I had mixed feelings when one learner said 
it was the first clear exercise in this course,
but hey, my exercise came across as clear :-)
