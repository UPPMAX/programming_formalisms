# Reflection day 5 autumn 2023

Before the lesson, I was already
regretting the fact that such a cool
topic is given on the last day of the
course: I was most tired that day
for the regular preparation time (from
5:00-9:00) and was least productive due
to that.

Additionally, I felt the need
to spend one hour on the Retrospective by
the learners and adept. I did,
at the cost of other things.

I will use the Retrospect to guide
the rest of my reflection.

## Only Day 5

### What went well?

- Pairing works much better +1

I mentioned I/we intended to nearly-always
do Pair Programming at the start of
my lecture,
when I discussed the Retrospective of the
day before.

- Using HackMD for UML was very nice. +2
- Using HackMD to code rather than screen sharing +3

I mentioned that any useful way to collaborate
are encouraged, at the start of
my lecture,
when I discussed the Retrospective of the
day before.

- nice too have R examples +1

Our two R users deserved some love :-)

- learning what modules are
- Activity diagram +2
- Once it worked, plantUML in VS code was very nice

## What held us back?

- too little time for material and exercises of morning session
- did not finish all of morning lecture +1
- More info about use-cases/activity diagrams. Use, differences etc.
- morning exercises rushed
- maybe somewhat unclear difference between use-case and activity diagrams +1
- UML issues +3
- Still material and exercise description

I won't discuss the morning section,
as it was not me that taught it.

- The presentation is less informative to follow on

Unsure if this was about my part.
If it was about my part, unsure what
it means.

- Still material and exercise description

This applies to both halves of the day.
I added explicit goals more often,
yet did not always do due to choices
I made regarding time management.

- profiling part was a little diffuse

Due to I chose to go through the Retrospect
of the day before, indeed, the exercise
was a little diffuse.

- some changes are not staged after Git pulling. No change..

This is a misconception and/or git feature.

## What can we improve?

- spend more time on use-case and activity diagrams +3
- provide the uml code for diagram examples in lecture
- talk more about design patterns +1 or maybe share some nice tutorials
- Written instructions for exercises
- Be clearcut on what to do in the exercise.

This is morning session, no comment. I copied
the lines that can apply to both here below.

- Written instructions for exercises
- Be clearcut on what to do in the exercise.

I agree, I chose not to have time to do
this for all exercise.

- Have a mini start-to-end exercise after the course where we can spend half the day running through a small piece of coding. Practise all of it.

I think this is an interesting idea. I do
think building up a shared repo is more
insightful though. OTOH, for the lesson
on optimization, it may be superior.

- examples for optimisation showing well- and poorly-optimised examples +1

Great idea! I somehow lost some old
examples and had not had the time to find
this.

# Conclusion Day 5

I am happy to see the learners and I
agree on what can be improved :-)
