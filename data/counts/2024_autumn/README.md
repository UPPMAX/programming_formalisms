# Counts

Goal of this experiment is to see how important camera usage is for
keeping learners in an online course.

## Data description

`[date]_counts.csv` field|Description
-------------------------|-------------------------------------
`time`                   |Time
`n_cam_on`               |Number of learners with the camera on. This excludes teacher(s) and assistants
`n_cam_off`              |Number of learners with the camera on. This excludes teacher(s) and assistants

## Other data

- Number of registrations: 23

## Conclusions

The amount of learners present throughout the course was around 8 (mostly
9, but 7 on Friday). Hence, we should expect `n_registrations / 3` 
active particpants.
