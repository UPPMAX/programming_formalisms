## Retrospective

Teachers are learners too. Please help us improve by sharing your opinion.
Ideally, it is something fixable, e.g. 'My camera did not work' is something
we cannot fix, but 'I had no way to interact (as my camera did not work) and the Zoom chat was not listened to' is.

### Continue: What went well?
- Pair programming
- Exercises sessions were dynamic and fun
- Pair programming was very instructive and fun.
- All the parts were a new way of seeing the process take form so I think all the exercises went well.
- Really fun with pair programming and learn from eachother.

### Improve: Which section(s) scheduled enough time for exercises?
-All was okay
- All exercises were very stressful since you have to do a reset/context switching everytime we change breakout rooms. Spend time on finding correct files and material.

### Stop: What held us back?
-I didnt feel anything hold us back today
- Maybe too simple of exercises
- Technical issues. Not so much time to spend on the actual exercise.
### Invent: What can we improve?
- A small section about what merge conflicts are and how to resolve them
- I didnt have any issue that has to be inprove.It went well.
-I think the first pair programming exercise was a little confusing since we did not have to both work on a same document. Maybe task to create a simple for loop where we individually have to contribute to a single def?
- Add some complementary exercises if there is available time
- I think it was very interesting
- More time to read through the exercise.
