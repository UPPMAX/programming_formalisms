# Retrospective day 5

Only Day 5 here :-)

Please, no pointing fingers (I am sure Jon would want me to say that :-) )

## What went well?

- Pairing works much better +1
- Using HackMD for UML was very nice. +2
- learning what modules are
- nice too have R examples +1
- Using HackMD to code rather than screen sharing +3
- Activity diagram +2
- Once it worked, plantUML in VS code was very nice


## What held us back?

- Still material and exercise description 
- The presentation is less informative to follow on
- did not finish all of morning lecture +1
- some changes are not staged after Git pulling. No change..
- More info about use-cases/activity diagrams. Use, differences etc. 
- morning exercises rushed
- maybe somewhat unclear difference between use-case and activity diagrams +1
- UML issues +3
- too little time for material and exercises of morning session
- profiling part was a little diffuse


## What can we improve?

- spend more time on use-case and activity diagrams +3
- provide the uml code for diagram examples in lecture
- Written instructions for exercises
- talk more about design patterns +1 or maybe share some nice tutorials
- Have a mini start-to-end exercise after the course where we can spend half the day running through a small piece of coding. Practise all of it.
- Be clearcut on what to do in the exercise. 
- examples for optimisation showing well- and poorly-optimised examples +1
