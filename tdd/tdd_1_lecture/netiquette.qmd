## Netiquette

![](programming_formalism_course.png)

## Why a netiquette?

Because it helps you learn and us teach effectively.

## We just need to know

Let us know

-   ... when you cannot be there
-   ... when you cannot use a camera
-   ... when you cannot use a microphone

No need to give a reason, we trust our students!

## We will be interactive

We should \[1-5\].

-   Turn on your camera
-   You should/can/will be asked questions :-)

E.g., from \[1\]:

> Evidence shows that instructors need to maintain substantial involvement in online courses \[2,3\]
