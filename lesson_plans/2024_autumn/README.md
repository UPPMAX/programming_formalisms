# Lesson plan Autumn 2024

- Author: Richel

## Suggested new schedule

### 2024-04-22

- risk analysis: no exercise, not needed for shared project
- use of ChatGPT to generate design documents: no exercise, 
  not needed for shared project (as the learners create the
  documents themselves)
- object orientation on Monday and Tuesday:
  no exercise, not needed for shared project,
  maybe do this at the OOP lecture on Friday
- inheritance on Monday and Tuesday:
  no exercise, not needed for shared project,
  maybe do this at the OOP lecture on Friday
- creating an own local GitHub repo: not needed for shared project
- markdown markup: no exercise, not needed for shared project,
  maybe do this at the documentation lecture on Friday
- mermaid markup on Monday: no exercise, 
  but I think it is important for class design on Tuesday
- putting Mermaid in a README on Tuesday during class design:
  no exercise, maybe do this at earlier
- optimization, not vital to the shared project
- documentation on Monday: no exercise, 
  instead do this at the documentation lecture on Friday
- pseudocode: no exercise, not needed for shared project


### 2024-04-23

- [ ] Next course iteration, do TDD in isolation first for at least 3 cycles,
      then start pair programming
- [ ] Next course iteration, strongly encourage the git teacher to discuss
      and cause merge conflicts, as they do happen in the basic
      git workflow when duos work on one file
- [ ] Next course iteration, encourage the git teacher to create
      empty classes

### 2024-04-24

- `git init`: not needed for shared project, can be done on GitHub
- `git branch -c`: can be done on GitHub
- `git graph`: can be done on GitHub
- `git diff`: can be done on GitHub
- `git show`: no exercise
- `git log`: no exercise, can be done on GitHub
- `git mv`: no exercise
- `git rm`: no exercise
- big code examples: can be simplified to a 'Hello world' program
- use multiple files: can be simplified to one file
- use big files: can be simplified to short files
- use complex commit graphs: can be simplified to simple commit graphs
- using more repos: can be simplified to only use the shared repo
- using git plugin: can be simplified by using GitHub view
- using GitHub templates: not needed for shared project
- using protected branches: not needed for shared project
- add using Issues: we do use these in the shared project!
- using command-line: if possible with GitHub
- [x] Settle on `git switch` and `git checkout`: which one is better?
  `git checkout` as there was one learner that could not use the
  alternative, as he had an older git version
- [ ] Next iteration: schedule 4 hours of TDD
- [ ] Next iteration, schedule a helper to do code reviews.

### 2024-04-26

- Suggest: remove aggregation, as we don't use it in the project
- Suggest: remove describing what one can do in `__init__.py`, 
  as we only use it to fix linter errors.
- Describe what containers are, do not compare the types
- Remove build systems, not needed for the project
- No virtual environments, not needed for the project
- No venv comparisons usage for different OSes, not needed for project
- No venv usage, not needed for project
- In-code documentation: either earlier, else not: 
  it is not needed for the project now, no formal terminology
- Documenting outside code: not needed for the project, no formal terminology
- Licensing: not needed for the project
- Static HTML website generator: not needed for the project
- I think making a package and using it is a good idea
  and suggest to do it
- No wiki: not needed for the project, no formal terminology
