### Meeting 2024-09-11 evaluation

I am happy we voted democratically on what the course goal is
and what is yes/no course content.

I do feel the course has been made worse by this.
These are my worries:

- We voted for the coarse goal of 'to give an understanding of formal
  principles of software development', instead of 'applying formal
  principles of software development'. I worry that we have failed
  to reduce lecturing and have failed to reduce lecturing useless content
  (there are many things I am not convinced of to be useful, even after have
  seen some of these topic being discussed multiple times; if something is
  said to be 'essential' does not convince me)
- We voted for 'Only what is used by the student project is course content,
  with alternatives relevant to academics provided in lecture (or extra
  material) to what we do'. I suggested 'Only what is used by the student
  project is course content' to reduce lecturing. Also here, I worry that we
  have failed to reduce lecturing

## Preparation

I will have 4 days to prepare, all of these disturbed my meetings.

- Tuesday: sketch all days
