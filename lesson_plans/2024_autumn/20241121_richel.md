- Author: Richel
- Date: 2024-10-21

On Thursday I will be discussing:

- (after Lars, on object-oriented design) class design
- has-a relation
- expressive data type
- (after Lars, on modular programming) Implement the project as a package

To do:

- [x] Create issues to fix the learners' project
- [ ] Create issues for learners that have broken the main branch    
- [ ] Tomorrow 8:00: Check Lars' work
- [ ] Determine order, no rush to work on the learners' project
