# Lesson plan Autumn 2024

On Thursday I will be discussing:

- (after Lars, on object-oriented design) class design
- has-a relation
- expressive data type
- (after Lars, on modular programming) Implement the project as a package

To do:

- [x] Create issues to fix the learners' project
- [x] Create issues for learners that have broken the main branch    
    - This was apparently fixed by a learner. Yay!
- [ ] Determine order for tomorrow, no rush to work on the learners' project
- [ ] Tomorrow 8:00: Check Lars' work

That is how I felt during the lesson yesterday. Now I have only a couple of
hours to update my material to the schedule. Let's plan things.

It is great to follow the pace of the learners, 
but now I am behind in schedule:

- [ ] Look at schedule, prioritize




Some questions for evaluation:

- git from command line or git from VS Code
