# Lesson plans autumn 2023

## Wednesday

Goals:

 * Catch-up
   * git basic workflow: exercise fairytale basic, [#4](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_autumn_2023/issues/4)
   * git with branches: exercise fairytale on branches, [#5](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_autumn_2023/issues/5)
 * Do lectures with exercises

Improvements:

 * Talk about CI is too long and vague,
   instead make the students feel the concepts
   first and do the `flip_coin`. Or:
   the CI part feels out of place: move it to
   later

### Reflection

Exercises felt at better length. 
The learners need time to get things to work
as part of the exercise and they had.

Before the lecture I felt the need to prepare
some git exercises, so the learners could
catch up from Monday:
 * git basic workflow: exercise fairytale basic, [#4](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_autumn_2023/issues/4)
 * git with branches: exercise fairytale on branches, [#5](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_autumn_2023/issues/5)
During the lesson, I felt doing this would not
pay off enough. It followed that the team would
get dozens of merge conflicts when working on
the same file. This was at an annoying time,
as we worked on real code they wanted to get
running and in perfect style. Also here:
I'd really enjoyed that this would have been done
on Monday with trivial text.

 * [ ] Do do the fairytale example on branches?
   ~~~Vote with learners~~~ Yes

The CI part was disconnected from the exercises.
The theory was too much and too vague.
I am happy I felt that during the lecture,
and I predict this was clearly noticeable.

The unittest part was thin: it was mostly
showing how to get code working. And I agree
that that should be the exercise. 
Do show the theory though, especially 
more Hamcrest example. Also, show the R
equivalents.

### Feedback

[I really wished I had had the csv with text,
I will screenshots for now]
