# Lesson plans autumn 2023

## Wednesday

Goals:

 * Catch-up
   * git basic workflow: exercise fairytale basic, #4
   * git with branches: exercise fairytale on branches, #5
 * Do lectures with exercises

Improvements:

 * Talk about CI is too long and vague,
   instead make the students feel the concepts
   first and do the `flip_coin`. Or:
   the CI part feels out of place: move it to
   later




## Thursdays

 * Catch-up
   * design of project:
     * Pick a project and Design Lead, #6
     * Decide upon class names and have class owners, #7
 * Do lectures with exercises
