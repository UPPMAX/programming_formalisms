## Breaks

Please take breaks: these are important for learning. 

It can sometimes be painful/annoying when there is a break in the middle
of the exercise. 

Ideally, do something boring @newport2016deep!

## Overview

 * Discuss: Reflection
 * Do: catch-up: generate and understand merge conflicts
 * Do: catch-up: work with branches
 * Learn and do: Data structures
 * Do: catch-up: Design project
 * Learn and do: algorithms

# Discuss reflection (10 mins)

 * Show on Programming Formalisms repository

# Do: catch-up: generate and understand merge conflicts

Goal: a learner should be able to explain why a merge conflict occurs

Demonstration:

 * Ask a student to modify `fairytale.md`
 * Show merge conflict, explain why

# Do: catch-up: work with branches

Goal: a learner should be able to create, switch and merge branches

 * Work on `fairytale.md`
 * Work on `main`, `develop`, `[name]`
 * Show exercise
 * Demonstrate, preferably a learner volunteer

# Data structures

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
import this
```

> \[...\] Readability counts. \[...\] If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. \[...\]

## What and why?

Data structure are 'ways to organize your data'. 

- Bad way: put all in one `list`

Good (:innocent:) data structures:

-   Increase expressiveness
-   Bundles data that belongs together
-   Ensures correct state of the program

# `struct` design

Good (:innocent:) data structures:

-   **Increase expressiveness**
-   Bundles data that belongs together
-   Ensures correct state of the program

## Increase expressiveness, in design

## structure versus class

| Parameter               | structure                    | class                       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Python keyword          | `class`                      | `class`                     |
| R object type           | S3 class                     | S4, R5, R6                  |
| All states are valid    | Yes                          | No                          |
| Maintains a valid state | No                           | Yes                         |

## Exercise 1: design a struct (15 mins)

Goal: 

- to convince design is trickier than one thinks
- to convince design has implications
- to grow appreciation of classes

## Exercise 1: design a struct (15 mins)

What are their elements?
Which do you guess are structures?
Were they?

- A coordinate in 3 dimensions :innocent:
- A velocity in two dimensions 
- A circle
- A square

## Exercise 1: a coordinate in 3 dimensions

 * consists out of an `x`, `y` and `z` coordinate
 * `struct`: all combinations valid

. . .

But:

 * Spherical coordinate: radial distance, polar angle, azimuthal angle
 * distance must be positive, hence `class`

## Exercise 1: a velocity in two dimensions 

 * consists out of a `delta_x`, `delta_y`: `struct`
 * consists out of a `angle`, `speed` (:monocle_face:): maybe `class`

## Exercise 1: a circle

A circle has:

- a center coordinat and ...
    - a diameter (:monocle_face:): maybe `struct`
    - a radius (:monocle_face:): maybe `struct`
- three coordinats: class, must avoid colinearity
 
## Exercise 1: a square

A square has 

- a center coordinat and size (:monocle_face:) and ...
    - maybe an angle (:monocle_face:)
- a top-left coordinat and size (:monocle_face:) and ...
    - maybe an angle (:monocle_face:)
- a two opposing coordinats: struct?

# `struct` relations

Good (:innocent:) data structures:

-   Increase expressiveness
-   **Bundles data that belongs together**
-   Ensures correct state of the program

## A has-a relationship

When one data type has a 'has-a' relationship with another, this is called *composition*.

![](struct_coordinat.png)

A `Coordinat` has an `x` and `y`

## Composition of structs

## Exercise 2: create overview of classes (15 mins)

Goals:

- Experience first step in design
- Allow feeling that design could be improved in hindsight
- Distribute ownership of project

## Exercise 2: overview of classes (20 mins)

-   Read project description
-   Which classes does the project need?
-   Together:
    -   make an alphabetic list of structures in the shared document
    -   add exactly 1 maintainer to each struct
-   Put the list on the GitHub project repository

Class name|Owner
----------|-----
Animal    |Anna
Duck      |Bas
.         |.

## Exercise 3: create structs (30 mins)

-   Per struct maintainer, create one group
-   Add the struct to the GitHub project repository

## Discussion

- Structures increase expressiveness of code
- The design of data structures has implications
- Structures are useful to bundle data
- It is rare that structures match the real world

Agreed yes/no?

# `class` design

## An invariant

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# The PlantUML does not render, even not after
# quarto add pandoc-ext/diagram
# See https://github.com/pandoc-ext/diagram/issues/6
#
# I use {python} as this renders nicer than verbatim
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
@startuml

class Range {
  + _lowest
  + _highest
}

@enduml
```

-   [C.8: Use class rather than struct if any member is non-public](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-class)

# Writing a good class

Q: What is a good class?

. . .

A:

-   guarantees its stored data is valid, e.g the class `DnaSequence` is probably a string of one or more A, C, G and T
-   the quality requirements for a function, among others a good interface
-   writing a design, documentation and tests all help

## General class anatomy

 * A constructor: all data needed to create it
 * Private member variables
 * Public member functions

## Class anatomy in R

 * R has four class types (S3, S4, R5, R6)
 * S3 classes are closest to structures
 * R6 classes are real classes

## Class anatomy in Python

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
def is_dna_string(s): return True
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
class DnaSequence:
    def __init__(self, sequence):
        assert is_dna_string(sequence)
        self._sequence = sequence # convention
    
    def get_str(self):
        return self._sequence

a = DnaSequence("ACGT")
assert a.get_str() == "ACGT"
```

## Private variables are a social convention

Use of `_` before the name of a private variable is a social convention!

```         
self._sequence = sequence # convention
```

Nothing stops you from:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
a._sequence = "XXX"
assert a.get_str() == "XXX"
```

Some other programming languages offer stronger guarantees.

## Inheritance and polymorphism

> C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much easier to generate total and utter crap with it.

> Linus Torvalds, 2007-09-06

## Inheritance and polymorphism

-   Can create class hierarchies
    -   'All Animal objects can make a sounds'
-   Easy to abuse, hard to use correctly
-   Design Patterns are known to work well

# Built-in data structures

## Problem

Are there classes that can help me solve problems more elegantly?

## Python classes

-   `list`: heterogeneous container
-   `tuple`: immutable `list`
-   `set`: sets
-   `dict`: dictionary
-   Regular expressions: text patterns

From [Python 'Data Structures' documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

## `set`

Sorted collection of unique elements.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
data = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
s = set(data)
assert 3 in s
assert list(s) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
```

-   No need to check for elements existing twice

## `dict`

A dictionary:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
periodic_table = dict({1: "Hydrogen", 2: "Helium", 3: "Lithium"})
periodic_table[2] = "helium"
assert periodic_table[2] == "helium"
```

-   Commonly uses as a look-up table
-   A look-up table can store the results of earlier calculations

## Regular expressions

A state-machine for a pattern in text

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import re
dna_regex = re.compile("^[ACGT]*$")
assert dna_regex.match("")
assert dna_regex.match("A")
assert dna_regex.match("CA")
assert dna_regex.match("GCA")
assert dna_regex.match("TGCA")
assert dna_regex.match("TGCAAAAAA")
assert not dna_regex.match("nonsense")
```
