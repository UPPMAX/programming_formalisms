Welcome, we are so happy that you have chosen to participate
in this fall edition of the Course Programming formalisms.

We hope to provide an good introduction to Programming formalisms and
current practical software development methods

Our course motto is turning scripters into computer scientists
and to add theory to bolster already present practical skills

This means that we will try to give some idea of why we develop the way
we develop as we show you one practical way
of making a software project from requirments gathering to deployment methods.

We will start November 18–22, 9:00-16:00 with
Online on-boarding: Friday Nov 15 9:00–10:00, drop-in. 
Get help with setups.

We will use the same zoom metting and password through out the course
