    Lesson plan:

    - 5 mins: prior knowledge
      - [questions]
    - 5 mins: presentation
    - 25 mins: challenge
    - 10 mins: feedback

## Introduction

Pair programming is a facet of developing code better.
We use it a lot in this course, because:

- we should
- it works great with recommended teaching practices


## Exercises

See the exercise procedure [here](../misc/exercise_procedure.md).

- Together, read the questions before reading the material
- Together, divide which team member is going to read which source:
    - [the Wikipedia page on Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
    - [Martin Fowler's page on Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)
    - (if with three: [Codecademy's page on Pair Programming](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-pair-programming/))
- Together, set a timer for 10 minutes
- Individually, answer the questions within the time limit
- Together, write down a shared answer on the GitHub project repository
  with path `learners/[a teammember's name]/pair_programming.md`
- Upload the file to the GitHub repo

Questions:

- What is pair programming?
- When to switch roles?
- How does a good pair behave?
- What effects does pair programming have?
