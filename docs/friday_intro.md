    - view the principles of deployment
    - practice preparing for installations by users
    - finalize the documentation of the project.

 
## Modular programming

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Modular programming'"

    - understand the principles of modular programming
    - practice principles of modular programming

- [Modular programming](deployment/deploy.md)
  
## Deployment

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Deployment'"

    - learners can mentalize the installation needs from the users perspective
    - learners can evaluate different available tools for reproducibility and installations
    - learners can prepare for different users: local computer, Cluster

- [Deploy](deployment/deploy.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Final documentation'"

    - learners can finalize the documentation of the project
    
- [Documentation](deployment/documentation.md)


We will be using our shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the `main`, `develop` and topic branches.
We merge coding using Pull Requests with code reviews.
