# Introduction to Friday

Today we will

- understand the principles of modular programming
- understand the principles of deployment

We will be using our shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the `main`, `develop` and topic branches.
We merge coding using Pull Requests with code reviews.
