# Introduction to Wednesday

!!! info "Today we will:"

    - learn and practice git workflows while coding
    - learn and practice formal testing 

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Understand git branches, git merge'"

    - explain and evaluate the usefulness for different git commands

- Understand [git branching and merging](git/branches.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Practice using git branches'"

    - create, switch and delete a `git` branch

- [Practice using git branches](git/apply_branches.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Understand git Pull Request with code review'"

    - explain and evaluate the usefulness of git Pull Request with code review

- [Understand git Pull Request with code review](git/pull.md)


???- info "Learning objectives of 'Practice doing a Pull Request using a code review'"

    - practice merging `git` branches
    - practice fixing merge conflicts
    - practice doing a code review

- [Practice doing a Pull Request using a code review](git/apply_merge.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Do formal testing'"

    - understand the benefit of using a testing framework
    - practice writing tests within a formal testing framework
    - understand the benefit of continuous integration tests
    - practice fixing continuous integration tests

- [Do formal testing](testing/README.md)

We will formalize our [practice test-driven development](tdd/README.md)
by using a standard branch model with code reviews
and maybe we start to [practice formal testing](testing/README.md).

We will be using our shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the `main`, `develop` and topic branches.
