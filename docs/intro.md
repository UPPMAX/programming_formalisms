# Introduction of the week

!!! note "Course mottos"

    - Turning scripters into computer scientists
    - Add theory to bolster already present practical skills

## Course overview

!!! info "Programming Formalisms goal"

    The goal of the course is
    to give scientists with some experience in programming and scripting
    [an understanding of formal principles of software development](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/54).

    Only what is used by the student project is course content,
    with alternatives relevant to academics provided in lecture
    (or extra material) to what we do
    ([#52](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/52)).
    As we need discuss alternatives besides the course content, by definition,
    all exercises cannot be part of the project
    ([#43](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/43)).
    Whenever we give some advice,
    we will try to supply a references to the literature
    ([#57](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/57)).
    You can always give anonymous feedback at any time
    [at the course 'Feedback' page](misc/feedback.md)
    ([#75](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/75)).

    Teach evidence-based or expert-recommended best practices on how to:

    - write design documents for a project
    - work as a team
    - share code
    - develop code
    - test code
    - optimize code
    - write reusable code
    - deploy code

    Understand and do formal software development practices:

    - understand, use and create a UML class diagram
    - understand and use a formal git branching model
    - understand and use a formal project workflow
    - understand and practice social coding,
      such as pair programming and code reviews
    - understand and use a run-time speed profiler

## Git/GitHub project

- We are going to use a GitHub repository in this course.
- You'll  also have local git repository of the same project.
- We'll set up these in the next session!
