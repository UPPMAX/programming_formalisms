# Algorithms

!!!- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Understand design by contract
    - Understand algorithm names increase expressiveness of code
    - Understand difference between `if` and `assert` in function writing

## Intro

How do I write functions [1] that are:

- easy to use
- correct
- fast [2]

References;

- [1] For now, we use `algorithm == function`,
  as the definition of an algorithm is
  'a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or
  accomplishing some end' @dictionary_algorithm
- [2] pick any vague definition

- [Function design](../function_design/README.md)
- [assert](../assert/README.md)
- [Recursive algorithms](../recursive_algorithms/README.md)

## Discuss

- Function design is hard
- Documentation helps
- TDD helps
- `assert` helps
