# Optimisation

!!!- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Understand misconceptions on optimisation
    - Understand Amdahl's law
    - Practice to determine the big-O profile of a function
    - Practice to get a run-time speed profile

## Why?

To improve the runtime speed (or memory use) of a program

We discuss:

- [Misconceptions](misconceptions.md)
- [Big-O](big_o.md)
- [Runtime speed profiles](runtime_speed_profiles.md)

## Case study

- [ ] Show ProjectRampal

## Discussion

- Be critical on speed optimization solutions
- Tested and clean code always comes first
- Measure correctly, at the right complexity, before and after
- Prefer changing big-O over micro-optimizations (but see first point!)

Agree yes/no?
