    - The students can turn a short requirements document and feature list into objects and make an inital class diagram, for the student project.-

**LINK TO MATERIAL**


???- info "Learning objectives for pair programming"

    - Understand why pair programming is important
    - Understand how good pair programming looks like
    - Practice pair programming

After learning about [pair programming](pair_programming/README.md),
we will adding stubs of these classes to our project.

???- info "Learning objectives for TDD"

    - Understand what TDD is
    - Understand why TDD is important
    - Practice TDD

To be able new features, we will 
[practice test-driven development](tdd/README.md)
in pairs.

We will be using our shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the main branch.
