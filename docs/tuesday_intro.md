# Introduction to Tuesday

Today we will create a class diagram of our project.

After learning about [pair programming](pair_programming/README.md),
we will adding stubs of these classes to our project.

To be able new features, we will 
[practice test-driven development](tdd/README.md)
in pairs.

We will be using our shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the main branch.
