# Continuous integration

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - .

???- question "For teachers"

    Prerequisites are:

    - Learners have .

    Teaching goals are:

    - Learners .

    Teaching form used:

    - .

    Lesson plan:

    - 5 mins: prior knowledge
        - When do you trust your code?
        - When do you trust code written by others?
        - How do you convince other developers of a bug?

    - 5 mins: presentation
    - 10 mins: demonstration `is_zero`
    - 25 mins: challenge
    - 10 mins: feedback

## Continuous Integration

Scripts that are triggered when `push`ing code.

Assures quality:

- Tests pass
- Code has consistent style
- Links are valid (i.e. not broken)
- Spelling is correct
- [your check here]

## Continuous Integration

- CI significantly increase the number of bugs exposed `[Vasilescu et al., 2015]`
- CI increases the speed at which new features are added `[Vasilescu et al., 2015]`

Course repo has CI :-)

## Code coverage

- Percentage of code tested
- Correlates with code quality `[Horgan et al., 1994][Del Frate et al., 1995]`
- 100% mandatory to pass a code peer-review by rOpenSci `[Hart et al., 2013]`

## Coding style

- Following a consistent coding style improves software quality `[Fang, 2001]`
    - Python: PEP8 `[PEP 8]`
    - R: Tidyverse `[Wickham, 2019]`
- May include cyclomatic complexity
    - More complex code, more bugs `[Abd Jader et al., 2018][Chen, 2019][Mens et al., 2008]`

## Coding style tools

- Linter: program that tests code for style.

In Python: `ruff`, Sonar, `pytype`, Black, Codacy, Pylint, Flake8,
`autopep8`, Pychecker, Pylama

## Disable a `ruff` test

```python
import random
i = random.randint(0, 1) # noqa: S311
```

You will need to defend this in a code review.
