# Testing

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - understand the benefit of using a testing framework
    - practice writing tests within a formal testing framework
    - understand the benefit of continuous integration tests
    - practice fixing continuous integration tests

???- question "For teachers"

    Prerequisites are:

    - Learners have practiced pair programming
    - Learners can do the git basic workflow on `master`

    Teaching goals are:

    - Learners understand what TDD is
    - Learners understand why TDD is important
    - Learners have done multiple TDD cycles

    Teaching form used:

    - Pair programming
    - `master` branch

    Lesson plan:

    - 5 mins: prior knowledge
      - When do you trust your code?
      - When do you trust code written by others?
      - How do you convince other developers of a bug?

    - 5 mins: presentation
    - 10 mins: demonstration `is_zero`
    - 25 mins: challenge
    - 10 mins: feedback

## Testing

- [Using a formal testing framework](testing_framework.md)
- [Continuous integration](continuous_integration.md)
- [Testing in a team and project](testing_in_a_team.md)

## Recap

-   Testing helps code correctness
    -   Use the Beyonc√© Rule on precious behavior
-   Testing + CI:
    -   Helps teaching
    -   Helps bug reporting

## Weaknesses

-   We developed only simple algorithms
-   We only use simple data structures
-   We ignore if code is fast (vague wording on purpose!)

This will be addressed in the next lectures :-)

## Observables

In duos, `owner_name` is the GitHub username first in the alphabet.

 * 1: `owner_name/is_prime(x)`
 * 2: `owner_name/get_digits(x)`
 * 3: `owner_name/flip_coin(x)`
 * 4: `owner_name/roll_dice(x)`
