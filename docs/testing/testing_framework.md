!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - understand the benefit of using a testing framework
    - practice writing tests within a formal testing framework

???- question "For teachers"

    Prerequisites are:

    - Learners have some idea of the benefit of using a testing framework
    - Learners have practiced writing tests within a formal testing framework

    Prior questions:

    - When do you trust your code?
    - When do you trust code written by others?
    - How do you convince other developers of a bug?

## Testing

???- question "Prefer this lecture as a video?"

    See [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/FXdEtzl-wws)

Testing *helps* ensure the correctness of code.

-   Coding errors are extremely common [Baggerly & Coombes, 2009]
-   Contribute to the reproducibility crisis in science [Vable et al., 2021], e.g. [Rahman & Farhana, 2020]

## Testing framework

-   **`unittest`**, `pytest`, `nose`, etc.
-   Makes it easier to write unit tests
-   Takes some scaffolding
-   Failed tests give a better error message

### Test if something is true

No testing framework:

```python
assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

Using `unittest`:

```python
import unittest

class TestSmall(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_is_true(self):
        self.assertIsTrue(1 + 1 == 2)
```

:neutral_face: Mostly scaffolding here

### Test if something is equal

No testing framework:

```python
assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

Using `unittest`:

```python
import unittest

class TestSmall(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_is_equal(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)
```

Hamcrest notation can give better error message.

### Test if something raises an exception

No testing framework:

```python
def raise_error():
    raise RunType("Raise an error!")

has_raised = False
try:
    raise_error() 
except:
    has_raised = True
assert has_raised
```

Using `unittest`:

```python
import unittest

class TestSmall(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_raises(self):
        self.assertRaises(RunTimeError, raise_error)
```

:smile: here it pays off.

## File setup

A testing framework needs files to be in standarized places.

One can search the web for this, 
or [use an existing project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_example_project)
as reference.

For the `unittest` framework, the actual functions are put in the
`src/[package_name]` folder, for example `src/bacsim/richel_utils.py`.

???- question "How does such a file look like?"

    Here is how such a file could look like:

    ```python
    """Richel's utility functions"""

    def is_zero(x):
        """Determine if `x` is zero.

        If `x` is not a number, a `TypeError` is raised.

        Returns `True` if `x` is zero
        """
        if not isinstance(x, (int, float)):
            msg = "'number' must be a number. "
            raise TypeError(
                msg,
                "Actual type of 'number': ", type(x),
            )
        return x == 0
    ```

The testing functions are put in the
`tests` folder and all files have `test_` added.
For example, the file to test `src/bacsim/richel_utils.py`
is called `tests/test_richel_utils.py`.

???- question "How does such a file look like?"

    Here is how such a file could look like:

    ```python
    """Tests all function in src.bacsim.richel_utils."""
    import unittest

    from src.bacsim.richel_utils import is_zero

    class TestRichelUtils(unittest.TestCase):

        """Class to test the functions in src.bacsim.richel_utils."""

        def test_is_zero(self):
            """Test 'is_zero'."""
            self.assertIsNotNone(is_zero.__doc__)
            self.assertTrue(is_zero(0))
            self.assertTrue(is_zero(0.0))
            self.assertFalse(is_zero(1))
            self.assertRaises(TypeError, is_zero, {1, 2})
            self.assertRaises(TypeError, is_zero, "I am a string")
    ```

## Running a test

???- question "Get error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`?"

    You will get the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`
    when you click 'Run' on your file with tests.

    ![](running_a_test_script_normally_fails_annotated.png)

    > Clicking on 'Run' (see the red rectangle at the top-left) for a file that has tests
    > will give the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`.
    > Click the green 'Testing' tab at the right instead.

    Instead, click on the green 'Testing' tab at the right.

Click on the 'Testing' tab (with the erlenmeyer flask) at the right.

If you do this for the first time, you get some blue buttons.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ![](testing_tab_first_click.png)

Click on 'Configure Python Tests'.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ![](testing_tab_select_framework.png)

Select 'unittest Standard Python test framework'

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ![](testing_tab_select_test_folder.png)

Select `tests` as the testing folder.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ![](testing_tab_select_test_file_pattern.png)

Select `test_*.py` as the test file pattern.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ![](testing_tab_tests_present.png)

Now the tests are present at the left side in a folded up state.
One can unfold these.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ![](testing_tab_tests_present_and_run.png)

Clicking on the 'Run'/'Play' button to run the tests.

## Exercises

## Exercise 1: first attempt

???- info "Learning objectives"

    - practice writing tests within a formal testing framework

In pairs, develop a function using TDD using the `unittest` framework.

The function is a function to determine if a number is prime.

???- question "Too easy or too hard?"

    The learning objective of this exercise is to 
    practice writing tests within a formal testing framework.
    Which function to implement is irrelevant,
    so feel free to pick a function that fits your level.
    If needed, there are many worked-out functions 
    [here](../misc/functions.md)

!!! info "The function"

    -   Function name: `is_prime_[names]`, for example, `is_prime_anna_and_sven`
    -   Output:
        -   Returns `True` if the input is prime
        -   Returns `False` if the input is not prime
        -   Gives an error when the input is not one integer

!!! info "Social"

    -   Ping-Pong Pair programming
    -   Discuss how and when to switch roles first!
    -   Decide who is the first driver, e.g. the person with first name first in alphabet
    -   Try to be **an exemplary duo**

!!! info "Technical"

    -   Create a topic branch for your pair. Branch of from `develop`
    -   Work within scaffolding of the learners project
        -   Functions are in `src/[package_name]/`. 
            Call the file `utils_[names].py`, e.g. `utils_anna_and_sven.py`
        -   Tests are in `tests/`.
            Call the file `test_utils_[names].py`, e.g. `test_utils_anna_and_sven.py`
    -   When done, create a Pull Request to `develop`. Do not merge!

???- question "Need a video?"

    See [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/jwAyMlaODfo) 

## Exercise 2: second attempt

???- info "Learning objectives"

    - practice writing tests within a formal testing framework

In pairs, develop a function using TDD using the `unittest` framework.

Use the same setup as exercise 1.

However, decide upon an interesting function at your estimated level.
When disagreeing: pick the easiest function.

If needed, one can find inspiration at the section [Other functions](#other-functions) below.

## Exercise 3: your classes

???- info "Learning objectives"

    - practice writing tests within a formal testing framework

Everyone is the owner of a class.

In pairs, develop functionality for your classes
using TDD using the `unittest` framework.

Use the same setup as exercise 2, except one uses 
a branch called after the owner of each class.
For example, Anna's class is developed on the `anna` branch
and Sven's class on the `sven` branch.

'develop functionality' is still hard, as we have not
discussed function design, nor class design.

However, we can:

- ensure the class is in a file called `[class_name].py`,
  e.g. `coordinat.py`
- ensure the tests are in a file called `test_[class_name].py`,
  e.g. `test_coordinat.py`, so that `unittest` can actually find it
- write a minimal test is that one can create a class object:

```python
class TestCoordinat(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_can_create(self):
        Coordinat c
```

- write as much tests as the pair can come up with.
  In case of conflict what is good architecture, 
  the class owner decides. Again, this is hard, 
  as we have not
  discussed function design, nor class design.
