# Retrospective day 4

Copied literally.

## What went well?

- The pull request part was really imprssive
- Found the pull request aspect of the practical useful +1
- Git pairing is more efficient
- .
- Hands on
- Refelcting on earlier feedback +1
- CI is quite cool. HackMD is good for discussion
- Testing proper git workflow +1
- Practising with opening issues, assigning them, opening pull requests on GitHub, as well as dealing with merge conflicts
- Interactive
- enthusiastic teaching! +2
- Nice practice time and pair coding
- Going back to revise the pull requests. I learnt alot from that. +1
- Responded to feedback
- Frequent breaks. +1

## What held us back?

- Made a mistake on a pull request and got time shortage for merge part
- PR opened when the develop branch failed seems not update automatically when develop was fixed
- correct pull request was overwirtten
- exercise goals not always clear
- Material should be more informative
- Screensharing on linux
- [Richel moved this to here] I couldn't start my own HackMD doc for live coding with subscribing.

## What can we improve?

- Speed a litte bit to make decrease in the lecture part
- More discussion around appopriate classes/structs for solving project.
- Work with an established exercise
- I would have liked more indept discussion about data structures and algorithms. Here you didn't say much more than that they are concepts you can use. (+1)
- write some light program thats can actually do something, e.g., visualize the bacteria moving?
- explain how to setup CI locally? so it automatically check the sutomation before push
- It may sometimes make sense to be in groups of 3 (vs 2) - but I guess this is subjective
- HackMD pages for shared coding? Maybe I missed it but I think it could be better than screensharing. - Students get thier own mini projects to go thru all the practices. Rather than scattered excercises.
- state goals before each break out room
