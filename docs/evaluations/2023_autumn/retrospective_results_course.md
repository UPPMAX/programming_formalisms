# Retrospective course

Here we have a Retrospective on the course as a whole.
This retrospective was done at the end of day 5.

Please, no pointing fingers (I am sure Jon would want me to say that :-) )

## What went well?

- Pair programming +3
- Lots of exercises +2
- Windows XP background -1
- Github workflow (CI) +2
- Hand-on demos that can be used in the future +3
- Provided an opportunity for more social programming, including working in a live github repository where other people are working +1
- Frequent breaks +3
- Time for questions and answers
- teachers are enthusiastic and seem to know what they're talking about
- Good level of social interaction +1
- Well expereicned teachers +1
- chatting during breaks +1
- cats +4
- providing references

## What held us back?

- Lars rushed through the last parts of his lectures
- Too low tempo, especially in the lectures. +1
- Some excercises could be explained better. We spent a lot of time just discussing what we were supposed to do. +1
- Unclear desciption and explanation of exercises +5
- (Still) too many lectures -- Zoom fatigue
- Some parts of the pair programming seems not needed
- Presentations
- Balance between lectures and exercises.
- Skipping over content throughout the course; it gets confusing
- might be helfpul to do the git stuff all together
- too often told to not point fingers :finger_gun:
- less reading documents after Wed.
- too manny cats -6
- Different levels of preparation, everyone does not fulfill course prerequisites or preparations from last friday


## What can we improve?

- If exercises or examples are related with published papers
- Personally, I felt that the course was held at too low level. I was expecting more details and technical discussion, especially in the algorithm and data structure sections and I was familiar with most of the course content. In the future I would suggest that you should make it more clear what level of material to expect. +1 (but in the opposite direction - found a lot was very technical)
- More focus on a project to try out all the things taught in the course. Design -> Tests -> Implementation -> Iterations
- If there is an opportunity giving small group project and make presentation at the final day
- The course website should be keep maintaining
- No need to attempt completeness, one week is not enough -- material on top of what is discussed in documentation on GitHub -- more exercises, less lectures
- provide the correct/complete presentation PDFs on GitHub
- The coures was 'top-heavy'. The beginning (in my opinion) should be more interactive and with more utilities, like git, being taught. After the first day, then you can bring in more and more theory.
- I think when it is online, the course is limited in several certain ways. MAybe consider on-sote class?
- it would be nice to survey attendees beforehand for their favourite languages and experience with specific parts of the course - e.g some are gitmasters, some have never used git before and found it confusing af - and tailor classes appropriately
- Show more "good" github repos
- 🐱🐱🐱 more cats 🐱🐱🐱 +2
- additional animals +3
- Additional materials
- more dogs :dog2:
- more on design of larger program projects
- More examples of how these things are practiced in an academic setting

- if possible, work only on example project (no planets,no bacteria)
