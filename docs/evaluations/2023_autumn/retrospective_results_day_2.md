# Retrospective day 2

Copied literally.

## What went well?

- Interactive activities were great hands-on experience
- Nice to live-view pair programming! +2
- Right amount of content in lectures, not too dense
- pair programming is fun +1
- Exposure myself to the new environment(pair-programming) +1
- More theories and practice of software development
- Pair programming
- Pair programming has a lot of fun!
- I think it is nice to try out with people from different field. +1
- More interactivity, less pure lecturing
- presentation slides available

## What held us back?


- Some of the lectures were too long with little opportunity to discuss
    - Thanks for the feed back, this is somthing we will be working on
- Still a bit too little practice time +2
- It was a bit difficult to follow the slides on pair programming
- Technichal issues (sharing code, )
- I couldn't find the slides for pair programming (PDF)
- First time forking repo during pair programming exercise +1
- As a beginner, fixing the environmnt and knowlage gap for pair-programming.
- No time for exercise 2 and 3 during the morning +1
    - Thank you this is one of the main issues I will look into
- Less detailed documentation on GitHub than yesterday, though topics more complex
- Pair-programming exercise could have been better guided (suggest platforms before sending to breakout rooms)


## What can we improve?

- When discussing programming paradigms in the morning, it would be interesting to hear about how the different strategies are viewed and have been viewed by programmers over time, especially since they are to some extent not compatible with each other.
- Tell exactly where to find the material on github (-1)
- SSH stopped working for me :(
- The content from the lectures this morning looked interesting but too dense for beginners. I think a reduced version would have been more effective.
- Some of the 'handover' for the activities were unclear. We spent 5 minutes or so trying to figure what we were supposed to be doing. (+1)
- Summary of content from slides, key takeaway points.
- Have a summary session in the end of each day? I was absent for a session and would be good to know. (-1)
- Would be good to have more bathroom breaks (+2)
- If there is a an on and off suppervision, which can facilitate or enhance the coding in abetter way.
- Some breakout rooms could be cut in favor of longer discussions, alternatively menti first and discussions afterward
- make it clear when we are moving to Menti
