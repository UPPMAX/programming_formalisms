	For today, during the pair programming, I will group you with someone very comfortable with VSCode. In that way, you'll catch up better

	Hi Alice, for today, during the pair programming, I will group you with someone very comfortable with Python. In that way, you'll catch up better :-) . Will be fun!

11:15:30 From Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] To L3 (direct message):
	Hi L3, welcome back! Want me to get you up to speed?
	
11:33:35 From Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] To L4 (direct message):
	The answer is that you change branches in a folder that has an analysis running, the files will be changed to the versions on that branch. 
	
	This is just as much a problem as in other contexts: I think it results in undefined behavior :-)
	
11:34:27 From L4 To Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] (direct message):
	thanks
	
11:34:40 From Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] To L4 (direct message):
	I hope it helps :-)
	
11:34:46 From L4 To Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] (direct message):
	so so
	
11:35:03 From L4 To Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] (direct message):
	I was looking for a way to avoid duplicates
	
11:35:23 From L4 To Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] (direct message):
	maybe using tree
	
11:35:28 From L4 To Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] (direct message):
	or something like that
	
11:36:50 From Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] To L4 (direct message):
	A code repository is not too big (typically megabytes), so duplicates are fine. I actually do this: run code someplace and modify elsewhere :-)
	
11:38:57 From L4 To Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] (direct message):
	I might start doing that
	
11:39:19 From Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Silent observer] To L4 (direct message):
	I typically run code on an HPC cluster and develop locally :-) . It works great!
