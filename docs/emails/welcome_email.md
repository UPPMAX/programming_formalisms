# Welcome email

Welcome, we are so happy that you have chosen to participate
in `[edition]` edition of the Course Programming formalisms.

We hope to provide an good introduction to Programming formalisms
and current practical software development methods

Our course motto is turning scripters into computer scientists
and to add theory to bolster already present practical skills

This means that we will try to give some idea
of why we develop the way we develop
as we show you one practical way of
making a software project from requirements gathering to deployment methods.

We will start at

- (optional) `[onboarding data]` with an on-boarding session: here we'll
  help you get ready for the course
- `[course start data]` the course starts at 9:00 sharp

We will use the same Zoom room and password through out the course
