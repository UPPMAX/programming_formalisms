# Onboarding

- Email title: Programming Formalisms: preparation and start

Welcome!

We are happy that you have chosen to participate
in the Programming Formalisms course,
where we turn scripters into computer scientists.

Prepare yourself by going through the
pre-requirements at
[https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/prereqs/](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/prereqs/):
there is a checklist there. If you struggle or are uncertain
with a pre-requirement: the onboarding session is there to help you out!

Minimal schedule (with full schedule at
[https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/intro/#schedule](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/intro/#schedule)):

- `[date][day][time]` (optional) Onboarding
- `[date]` Monday 9:00 (sharp!): start of lessons

See you at the optional onboarding or Monday 9:00 (sharp!)
at the Programming Formalisms course, in the Zoom room below.

Cheers, the Programming Formalisms team
