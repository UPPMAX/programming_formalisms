# Editorial policies

From [Science editorial policy](https://www.sciencemag.org/authors/science-journals-editorial-policies):

> "We require that **all computer code used for modeling and/or data analysis** that is not commercially available be deposited in a **publicly accessible repository** upon publication."

From [Nature editorial policy](https://www.nature.com/authors/policies/availability.html):

> "A condition of publication in a Nature Research journal is that authors are required to make **materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available** to readers without undue qualifications."

---

# Are these policies working?

> "When you approach a PI for the source codes and raw data, you better explain who you are, whom you work for, why you need the data and what you are going to do with it."

# Motivation for open source software

- Enable derivative work
- Do not lock yourself out of own code
- Attract developers
- Engagement from industry
- It could become standard

---

# Sharing software is also scary

- Fear of being scooped
- Exposes possibly "ugly code"
- Others may find bugs and mistakes
- Others may require support and ask too many questions
- Fear of losing control over the direction of the project
- "Bad" derivative projects may appear

---

# Code reusability

Types of things that can be reused:

- Main libraries (e.g. NumPy, SciPy)
- Special scientific libraries
- Random code from website
- Copying from Stack Overflow

> - Do you want others to reuse what you make?
> - How do you turn your own small project into the next NumPy? Do you want to?

# Sharing or not sharing?

- "Everyone's work" depends on outputs from others.
- Sharing your output depends on how you obtained your input.
- A repository that is private today might become public one day.
- Sometimes "OTHERS" are you yourself in the future.
- **Software licenses** matter.
