## TDD

### How do you grow your code?

- Look at pre-existing (relevant) code and sketch by hand (flow chart)
- Often start with a prototype in Jupyter to solve a specific problem, then turn it into a script or a program if I need to use it often.
- Top-down, start were appropriate and hopefully end up where intended ;)
- Prioritize steps aka having a meeting with the memebrs within the project.Then split the works and reiterate all of the steps.
- Top-down in the beginning and then filling in with more features if needed
- steal from stack overflow/other forums
