# Project start with analysis 

## Requirements

Richard Harwell et. al states
*"Each contract specialist, lawyer, engineer,
systems engineer, manager, or anyone else involved in
the transition Division into product, bas his or her own
definition of a requirement, Withthe rareexception, all
arc applicable and mcaningful"* [1] 

-- "What is a Requirement?" by R. Harwell et al. from Proc. 3,dAnn. lnt' I Symp. Nat'I Council Systems Eng.,
1993, pp. 17-24.
 
What quidance can we then gleen in what a Requirment is the above mentioned paper asses that 
 *"if it mandates that somthing must be accomplished, transformed, produced, or provided, it is a requirment"*

???- "Where do you start?"

    - project brief, if you are given a project breif or write one your self the project breif should state the problem you would like to solve and any related ideas and constraints you have on the project. This is done in plain english
    - Problem statement, the problem statement is a subset of the project breif as it only deskribes the problem you wish to solve.


!!! info "Finding the needs!"

    Is a process of finding the subjects and verbs of the project brief and formalise them as testable statements, once that is done we do our firast iteration of risk analysis on those sets.

???+ exercise "Needs determination"

    We now look at the Course project and start setting upp our first development diagrams and design documents for the course project.

???- info "Hint!"

    Start by looking at the example design document ![Design Process Document](../../projects/example_project/DPD_unassisted.md) How we design
    ![Requirement document](../../projects/example_project/DPUA_requirementspecification.md)

???- info "Hint!"

    Analyse the project breif and make 5 short statements about the software

### Risk analysis

!!! info "Requirements matrix to Feature list"

    Using the Requirements and risk matrix we can design a feature list these can be tracked using issues in Git or in a separate document the feature list describes how to solve a requirment in plain text english and with flowcharts
