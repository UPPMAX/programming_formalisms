# Project start with analysis 

## Requirements
!!! info "Why do we need to specify requirements?"
    According to Merlin Dorfman (article reproduced in chap 1 requirements engineering) the results from the software crisis in the 1960s gave rise to the following problem *"In nearly every software project which fails to meet performance and cost goals,requirements inadequacies play a major and expensive role in project failure"* 

This is very much still the effect today in the production of scientific software (My personal opinion)

Richard Harwell et. al states
*"Each contract specialist, lawyer, engineer,
systems engineer, manager, or anyone else involved in
the transition Division into product, bas his or her own
definition of a requirement, With the rare exception, all
arc applicable and meaningful"* [1] 

-- "What is a Requirement?" by R. Harwell et al. from Proc. 3,dAnn. lnt' I Symp. Nat'I Council Systems Eng.,
1993, pp. 17-24.
 
What guidance can we then gleen in what a Requirement is the above mentioned paper asses that 
 *"if it mandates that something must be accomplished, transformed, produced, or provided, it is a requirement"*

According to ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 (Systems and software engineering — Life cycle processes — Requirements engineering)
**Defining requirements begins with stakeholder needs (or goals, or objectives) that are refined and
evolve before arriving as valid stakeholder requirements.**

!!!- "info What is a well formed Requirement"
    A well-formed specified requirement contains one or more of the following:
        — it shall be met or possessed by a system to solve a problem, achieve an objective or address a stakeholder concern;
        — it is qualified by measurable conditions;
        — it is bounded by constraints;
        — it defines the performance of the system when used by a specific stakeholder or the corresponding capability of the system but not a capability of the user, operator or other stakeholder; and
        — it can be verified (e.g., the realization of the requirement in the system can be demonstrated).

!!! info "Finding the needs!"

    Is a process of finding the subjects and verbs of the project brief and formalize them as testable statements, once that is done we do our first iteration of risk analysis on those sets.

???- "Where do you start?"

    - project brief, if you are given a project brief or write one your self the project brief should state the problem you would like to solve and any related ideas and constraints you have on the project. This is done in plain english
    - Problem statement, the problem statement is a subset of the project brief as it only describes the problem you wish to solve.



???+ exercise "Needs determination"

    We now look at the Course project and start setting upp our first development diagrams and design documents for the course project.

???- info "Hint!"

    Start by looking at the example design document ![Design Process Document](../../projects/example_project/DPD_unassisted.md) How we design
    ![Requirement document](../../projects/example_project/DPUA_requirementspecification.md)

???- info "Hint!"

    Analyze the project brief and make 5 short statements about the software

### Risk analysis

!!! info "Requirements matrix to Feature list"

    Using the Requirements and risk matrix we can design a feature list these can be tracked using issues in Git or in a separate document the feature list describes how to solve a requirement in plain text english and with flowcharts
