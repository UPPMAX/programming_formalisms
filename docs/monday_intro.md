# Introduction to Monday

!!! info "Today we will:"

    - Set the start in why a formalized development of software is needed.
    - Identify the main topics and objectives for the week's lessons.
    - Learn bout the tools and processes in the software development cycle.
    - Start a software project following a formalized development and tools.

!!! info "How?"

    1.  We start with a more theoretical introduction covering the software and tools and mindsets for software development.

    2.  The second part follows the development of a simple software project.

        - The exercises and type-alongs are to some extent based on copy-pasting code.

        - So you don’t need to program yourself or understand the python syntax used.

        - The important aspect is the workflow!

    3. Deeper material not covered in the lessons today can be found in the extra reading part.

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Introduction'"

    - Identify the main topics and objectives for the week's lessons.
    - Evaluate the importance of engaging with course content and identify strategies to maintain interest and motivation throughout the week.        

    - We will set the start in why a formalized development of software is needed.

???- info "Learning objectives of 'SDLC tools'"

    - Compare and contrast various software development tools and justify their relevance to specific development tasks.

- [SDLC tools](introductions/sdlc_tools.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Get started with Git/GitHub'"

    - Demonstrate the ability to initiate and manage a software development project using Git and GitHub.
    
- [Get started with Git/GitHub](project_start/startup.md)


???- info "Learning objectives of 'Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)'"

    - The student has an undertanding of the overview concepts software development process and understands the basic reasoning behind iterative software development
    - Content
        - Define the fundamental concepts introduced in the course and explain their significance in software development.
        - Explain the core principles and theories underlying software development concepts covered in the course.

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Project start with analysis and design'"

    - Analysis
        - The student understands and can show how to de construct a project breif into a requirments document then transfer that into a simple matrix based risk anlysis.
        - The students complete a requirements gathering and risk analysis for the Student Project
    - Content    
        - Execute basic Git commands to perform version control tasks and manage project repositories effectively.
        - Apply analytical and design techniques to plan and conceptualize software development projects effectively.

        - understand the basics of a analysis and design 
        - analysis
            - Talk about risks
            - UML
        - design
            - UML, (pseudocode)
            - modular intro
            - object orientation intro (students ready for Tue morning)
        - get started with planning the project
