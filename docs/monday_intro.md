# Introduction to Monday

Today we will:

- understand the basics of a design
- do the basic `git` workflow

We will be using a shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the main branch.
