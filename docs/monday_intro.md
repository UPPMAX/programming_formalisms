!!! hint

    1. We start with a more **theoretical introduction** covering the software and tools and mindsets for software development.
    2. The second part follows the development of a simple software **project**.
        - The exercises and type-alongs are mostly based on copy-pasting code.
        - So you don't need to program yourself or understand the python syntax used.
        - The important aspect is the **workflow**!
    3. **Deeper material** not covered in the lessons today can be found in the extra reading part.
