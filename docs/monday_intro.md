# Introduction to Monday

Today we will:

- get an overview of the Software development lifecycle
- get an overview of the tools
- understand the basics of a design

- get started with a git/github project
- get started with planning the porject
- do the basic `git` workflow


!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - give an **introduction** to the week
    - give some introduction to **concepts** used in the course
    - give some introduction to handy **tools for the software developer**
    - try to **set up the mindset** to find the rest of the week interesting and useful!
    
    - Practice to ...
    - Practice to ...
    - Understand ...

???- info "Learning objectives of 'XXX'"

    - practice merging `git` branches
    - practice fixing merge conflicts
    - practice doing a code review

- [Practice doing a Pull Request using a code review](git/apply_merge.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'XXX'"

    - understand 
    - practice writing tests within a formal testing framework
    - 
- [Do formal testing](testing/README.md)

We will formalize our [practice test-driven development](tdd/README.md)
by using a standard branch model with code reviews
and maybe we start to [practice formal testing](testing/README.md).

We will be using our shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the `main`, `develop` and topic branches.

!!! hint

    1. We start with a more **theoretical introduction** covering the software and tools and mindsets for software development.
    2. The second part follows the development of a simple software **project**.
        - The exercises and type-alongs are mostly based on copy-pasting code.
        - So you don't need to program yourself or understand the python syntax used.
        - The important aspect is the **workflow**!
    3. **Deeper material** not covered in the lessons today can be found in the extra reading part.
