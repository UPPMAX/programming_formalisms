# Introduction to Monday

!!! info "Today we will:"

    - set the start in why a formalized development of software is needed.
    - identify the main topics and objectives for the week's lessons.
    - learn bout the tools and processes in the software development cycle.
    - start a software project following a formalized development and tools.

!!! info How?

    1.  We start with a more theoretical introduction covering the software and tools and mindsets for software development.

    2.  The second part follows the development of a simple software project.

        - The exercises and type-alongs are mostly based on copy-pasting code.

        - So you don’t need to program yourself or understand the python syntax used.

        - The important aspect is the workflow!

    3. Deeper material not covered in the lessons today can be found in the extra reading part.

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Introduction'"

    - Identify the main topics and objectives for the week's lessons.
    - Evaluate the importance of engaging with course content and identify strategies to maintain interest and motivation throughout the week.        

    - We will set the start in why a formalized development of software is needed.

- [Introduction](introductions/intro.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)'"

    - Define the fundamental concepts introduced in the course and explain their significance in software development.
    - Explain the core principles and theories underlying software development concepts covered in the course.


- [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](introductions/sdlc_tools.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'SDLC tools'"

    - Compare and contrast various software development tools and justify their relevance to specific development tasks.

- [SDLC tools](introductions/sdlc_tools.md)

???- info "Learning objectives of 'Get started with Git/GitHub'"

    - Demonstrate the ability to initiate and manage a software development project using Git and GitHub.
    
- [Get started with Git/GitHub](project_start/startup.md)


???- info "Learning objectives of 'Project start with analysis and design'"

    - Execute basic Git commands to perform version control tasks and manage project repositories effectively.
    - Apply analytical and design techniques to plan and conceptualize software development projects effectively.

    - understand the basics of a analysis and design (LARS)
    - analysis
      - Talk about risks
      - UML
    - design
      - UML, (pseudocode)
      - modular intro
      - object orientation intro (students ready for Tue morning)
    - get started with planning the project (LARS)
        - We will have an introduction to some SDLC key features
        - We will get some theory of project tools and thinking.

- [Project start with analysis and design](project_start/analysis_design.md)

!!! hint

    1. We start with a more **theoretical introduction** covering the software and tools and mindsets for software development.
    2. The second part follows the development of a simple software **project**.
        - The exercises and type-alongs are mostly based on copy-pasting code.
        - So you don't need to program yourself or understand the python syntax used.
        - The important aspect is the **workflow**!
    3. **Deeper material** not covered in the lessons today can be found in the extra reading part.
