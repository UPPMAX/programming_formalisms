# Deploy your code

!!! questions

    - How to make your program work for others?

!!! info "Learning outcomes of 'Deployment'"

    - I can mentalize the installation needs from the users' perspective
    - I can initialize a new project

!!! info "Content"

    - We will prepare for installation of your code
    - But also...
        - some theory of packages
        - some theory of containers

???- note "Instructor notes"

    Prerequisites are:

    - Package

    Lesson Plan:

    - **Total** 75 min
    - Theory 20+10
    - Exercises 30+15 min

## Introduction

- It's about Distribution!

!!! note

    - Many projects/scripts start as something for personal use, but expands to be distributed.
    - Let's start in that end and be prepared.
    - The following steps can be very valuable for you in a couple of months as well as you revisit your code and don't know what it does or why you did this and that.

!!! attention

    - Make your program or workflow work for others and yourself in the future.

## Recording dependencies

- **Reproducibility**: We can control our code but how can we control dependencies?
- **10-year challenge**: Try to build/run your own code that you have created 10 (or less) years ago. Will your code from today work in 5 years if you donâ€™t change it?
- **Dependency hell**: Different codes in the same environment can have conflicting dependencies.

!!! note "Ways to distribute"

    - Python packages:
        - pip (PyPI)
        - conda
    - R:
        - R repos like CRAN and GitHub (devtools)
        - conda
    - Compiled languages:
        - built binaries (platform specific)
        - install from source
            - manual
            - make
            - CMake
    - General tools
        - Containers

???- info  "Conda & pip"

    **These _Python-related_ tools try to solve the following problems:**

    - **Defining a specific set of dependencies**, possibly with well-defined versions
    - requirements.txt...
    - **Installing those dependencies** mostly automatically
    - **Recording the versions** for all dependencies
    - **Isolated environments** (venv, virtualenv)
        - On your computer for projects so they can use different software.
        - Isolate environments on computers with many users (and allow self-installations)
        - Using **different Python/R versions** per project??
        - Provide tools and services to **share packages**

- Let's focus here on PyPI!
    - Remember we made a package this morning!
- We'll cover the other tools after the exercise.

### To make sure about needed dependencies

- Start with empty environment
- 2 levels of dependencies
    - system libraries
    - packages, like Python
- Nowadays platforms are less important, still "system files" may differ among OS platforms and Linux distributions
    - will your program require specific "system files"
    - are these typically not installed already?
    - in the **best world test on Windows/Mac and Linux platforms**
        - and with as empty as possible environment
- What about Shared services like a cluster where users and most staff do not have writing privileges ('sudo' rights) for system installations?

!!! discussion "Discussion: Where do you run your program?"

    - From a terminal?
    - On different computers?
    - On a cluster?

!!! info "We need to"

    - Inform what is needed to run the software in the README file
    - Or provide them with everything needed
        - hopefully not interfering with other software they are using

### Principle using python pip in a virtual environment

- We can make other users aware of the dependencies for our Python project.
- One can state those specifically as a list in a README
- Or, we can make a ready file (in python)

**Save your requirements as a file**

- You may have developed your Python program with your existing python modules environment. You may have installed some new packages during the development but did not track it in a good way.
- We need to identify what python packages a user (or you on another computer) will need, to make the program work!
    - There are many packages distributed in the "base" installation of Python so **it is not just to look at the import lines in the code**.
    - You may also be hard to get an overview because you have **too many import lines**, also distributed among files if you worked in a modular way

!!! example

    - [requirements.txt](https://github.com/bclaremar/planets-bjorn/blob/main/code/requirements.txt)

## Ignoring files and paths with .gitignore

Compiled and generated files are not committed to version control. There are many reasons for this:

- Your code could be run on different platforms.
- These files are automatically generated and thus do not contribute in any meaningful way.
- The number of changes to track per source code change can increase quickly.
- When tracking generated files you could see differences in the code although you haven't touched the code.

For this we use `.gitignore` files.

???- tip "Demo with planet"

    ```bash

        git switch -c venv
        python -m venv venv
        venv/Scripts/activate
        pip freeze  #should be empty
        ls
        cd code
        ls
        python planet_main.py
            import numpy as np
            ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'

        pip install numpy
        python planet_main.py
            ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'
        pip install matplotlib
        pip freeze
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        git add requirements.txt
        git commit -m "add requirements.txt"
        git push
        git switch main
        git merge venv
        git push
    ```


## Exercise 1: Identify lacking packages (15-20 min)

!!! tip

    - Work individually locally (in VS Code)
    - Help each-other if getting stuck

???- question "Step 1: Start an EMPTY python virtual environment"

    - Go to the dir ``learners/<your-name>``
    - Create a new folder called ``test``
    - Go into that folder
    - Create a virtual environment, called ``usertest``

        ```console
        python -m venv usertest
        ```

    - This creates an empty virtual environment located in `usertest` directory
    - Activate

    === "Mac/Linux"

        ```console
        source usertest/bin/activate
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```console
        source usertest/Scripts/activate
        ```

    - Note the ``(usertest)`` in the beginning of the prompt!

    ```console
    which python        #must point to the python belonging to the virtual environment
    python -V            # note this version
    which pip        #must point to the pip belonging to the virtual environment
    ```

    - Check it is empty with the command ``pip list``
    - It should just show

    ```bash
    Package    Version
    ---------- -------
    pip        23.2.1
    setuptools 65.5.0
    ```

    - and some notes.

???- question "(Optional Step 2: Add the folder to ``.gitignore``)"

    - Add test directory to .gitignore file

???- question "Step 3: Run the program and look for missing packages"

    ???- info "Hints"

        - The main program ``main.py`` is in the repo's root folder.
        - ``weather`` is a python package needed by ``main.py``
        - available here: <https://test.pypi.org/project/uppsalaweather/0.9/>

    - Go to the directory where ``main.py`` is
    - Run the program

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    - It may give you errors of missing packages, like ``weather``
    - Install weather with

    ```bash
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ uppsalaweather==0.9
    ```

    (note the blank space before the package name!

    - Test run the program again

    - If more packages are needed, errors will still show up
    - **Otherwise continue to next step**

    ???- question "How do I install other packages"

        ```console
        pip install <package name>
        ```

        - Do NOT use ``--user``, since it should be installed in the virtual environment only.
        - Do this until your program works

???- question "Step 4: Save your requirements as a file that user can run to get the needed dependencies"

    - Check what is installed by:

    ```console
    pip freeze
    ```

    - You will probably recognise some of them, but some may be more obscure and were installed automatically as dependencies.
    - Save your requirements as a file that user can run to get the needed dependencies.

    ```console
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

    - **Other users** can then install the same packages with:

        ```console
        pip install --user -r requirements.txt
        ```

    - End the isolated environment

    ```console
    deactivate
    ```

???- question "(Optional) Step 5: Test the requirements file in a new environment"

    - Double-check it works by:

    - Create another virtual environment

        ```console
        python -m venv usertest2
        ```

    - Activate

    === "Mac/Linux"

        ```console
        source usertest2/bin/activate
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```console
        source usertest2/Scripts/activate
        ```

    - Note the ``(usertest2)`` in the beginning of the prompt!

    ```console
    pip install --user -r requirements.txt
    ```

    - Run the program!

    No errors should show up!

### Follow up

???- tip "requirements file enabling test packages to be found"

    ```text
    --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple
    --pre
    uppsalaweather==0.9
    ```

    - possibly not all of the 3 upper lines are needed

???- question "(One person): Move a working requirements file to the ``src/learners`` folder"

    - Move the requirements file to the ``learners/source`` folder
    - This will be the "official" requirements file
    - That person git commit and pushes to GitHub!

    - [Build Systems Course](https://github.com/PDC-support/build-systems-course)

???- admonition "Containers"

    - Containers let you install programs without needing to think about the computer environment, like

        - operative system
        - dependencies (libraries and other programs) with correct versions

    ![Containerization](./img/Containerization_nextlabs.png)

    > From Nextlabs:
    
    !!! info

        - 2(3) types

            1. Singularity/Apptainer perfect for HPC systems
            2. Docker that does not work on HPC-systems

                - But docker images can be used by Singularity and Apptainer

        - Everything is included
        - Workflow:

            - Download on Rackham or local computer
            - Transfer to Bianca
            - Move to from wharf to any place in your working folders on Bianca

        - Draw-backs

            - you install also things that may be already installed
            - therefore, probably more disk space is needed

## Quality of life

- Run a python script without the ``python`` before in a linux environment!

- This line helps in the top of the main script:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/env python
    ```

- Then the python active in "PATH" will automatically be used
    - especially important on a shared system where python is not in the typical ``/usr/bin/python`` path.

## Start a Git/GitHub repo from personal existing project

- Many projects/scripts start as something for personal use, but expands to be distributed.
- Let's start in that end and be prepared.

### Principle

- Initiate git project
    - Browse to right _root_ directory (the folder containing all the project-related files)
- Stage and commit
- upload to github

### (Optional) exercise 2

!!! tip

    - Work individually locally (in VS Code)
    - Help each-other if getting stuck

- Let's say you have some code you have started to work with
- Start with 1A OR 1B

???- question "Exercise 1A: Start project from one of your existing projects"

    - Just use an existing programming project you have today
    - Browse to right _root_ directory (the folder containing all the project-related files)

???- question "Exercise 1B: Start a new test project"

    - Make a ``test_project`` directory in a good place (like a local ``Programming formalisms`` course folder)


    ???+ question "In VS Code?"

        - Make a new window
        - Open Folder

            ![start_VSC](../img/start_VSC.png)

        - Create new Folder with name ``test_project``
        - Select folder
        - Create and save a file ``hello.py`` with the following code base and the in-code documentation answering the question "why".

        ```python
        # We just want some output from a simple program
        print('Hello world!')
        ```

???- question "Exercise 2: Initiate the project"

    ???+ question "VS CODE"

        ![initialize_VSC](../img/initialize_VSC.png)

        - **RECOMMENDED** Publish to GitHub diectly **and you are done**!
            - You may change the name of the repo for the GitHub instance, but not recommended.
            - Include the file(s) (in this case the hello.py file) in the repo!
            - Double check it was created on GitHub!
                - It should show up under repos in your user space

        - ALTERNATIVE: Initialize and then continue with step 3.

    ???- question "Terminal"

        - Be in a terminal and go to the ``project`` folder, which will be the project repository (**repo**)
        - run ``git init``
        - make sure that there is a ``.git`` directory created
            - you have to show hidden files, in bash terminal with ``ls -a``

        - Now you have a git repo called ``test_project``
        - check with the command: ``git status``
        - It is always a safe command to run and in general a good idea to do when you are trying to figure out what to do next:


???- question "(Optional) Exercise 3: Add and commit the content"

    - So far, there is no content. We have to manually add the content to the repo.
    - Add and Commit your changes

    ???+ question "VS Code"

         We do this all the time! :)

    ???- question "Terminal"

        ```console
        git add
        git commit -m 'first commit'
        ```

???- question "(Optional) Exercise 4: Upload to GitHub"

    ???- question "In VS Code"

        - There is an opportunity to directly publish on GitHub

    ???- question "From GitHub"

        - Make sure that you are **logged into GitHub**.
        - You can use this for both VS Code and terminal

        ![New repo](../img/New_repo.png){ width=60% }

        - To create a repository we either click the green button "New" (top right corner).

        - Or if you see your profile page, there is a "+" menu (top right corner).

        ![New top-right](../img/new-top-right.png){ width=60% }

        ---

        - On this page choose a project name, e.g. ``test_project``

        - **NOTE** It is not necessary to have the same name but it makes things easier to know what is what when syncing between GitHub and git.

        - For the sake of this exercise **do NOT select** "Initialize this repository with a README"
        - and **NO Licence**

        ![New repo](../img/New_repo_formalisms.png)
        > Example project

        - Press "**Create repository**"

        ![Create and push](../img/created_push.PNG)

        - Choose **html**
        - Copy-paste the code for "**â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line**"
        - Go to **local git terminal** and go to the **git project you started above**
        - Paste the code

        - Did it work??
        - Reload the GitHub page and see the files present locally is also present there.

        **Done!**
