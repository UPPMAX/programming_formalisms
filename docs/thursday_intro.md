# Introduction to Thursday

Today we will:

???- info "Learning objectives for 'data structures'"

    - Practice to use classes for expression
    - Practice to use classes for type safety
    - Understand difference between composition and aggregation
    - Practice to use composition for a 'has-a' relationship

- [Understand data structures](data_structures/README.md)

???- info "Learning objectives for 'Understand algorithms'"

    - Understand design by contract
    - Understand algorithm names increase expressiveness of code
    - Understand difference between `if` and `assert` in function writing

- [Understand algorithms](algorithms/README.md)

???- info "Learning objectives for 'Understand optimisation'"

    - Understand misconceptions on optimisation
    - Understand Amdahl's law
    - Practice to determine the big-O profile of a function
    - Practice to get a run-time speed profile

- [Understand optimisation](optimisation/README.md)

We will be using our shared repository,
[the Programming Formalisms project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2024),
where we work on the `main`, `develop` and topic branches.
We merge coding using Pull Requests with code reviews.
