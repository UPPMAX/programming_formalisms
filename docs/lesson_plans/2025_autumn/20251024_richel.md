I think I should, as usual:

- [ ] Talk about me

Based on the Retrospect of the day before, I feel I need to fix some things:

- [ ] Discuss the course website
- [ ] Discuss the evaluation form
- [ ] Discuss the course project website
- [ ] Discuss the VSCode way, next to the git commands
  Show [the course's git course material](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/misc/git_workflow/)

Then, just follow the course material: it is ready!
