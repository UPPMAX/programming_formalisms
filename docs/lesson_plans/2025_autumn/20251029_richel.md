My teaching:

Day      |Time       |Teacher|Subject                                       |Status
---------|-----------|-------|----------------------------------------------|------
Wednesday|09:00-09:45|Richel |Implement the project as a package            |Done
Wednesday|10:00-11:00|Richel |Runtime speed profiles, Improve run-time speed|Done

My course material is good enough.
I feel I have invested enough time in the course.
I instead focus on improving the course.

I hope we ask the following question to our learners:

Imagine you are boss. How would you improve the Programming Formalisms
course? Do consider that if you want more of something,
what would you want less of?

## My questions for students

Less time, more time, remove or good as it is?
