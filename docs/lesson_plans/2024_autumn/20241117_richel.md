# Lesson plan Autumn 2024

I feel that there is too little time for the shared project,
due to more time for theoretical things. On the other hand,
as this is a given, I should be able to make my exercises
use the project more...

Instead of discussing CI, I will put it on the project itself,
so the learners can feel what it does.

- [x] Put CI in project
- [x] TDD
- [x] Put TDD example code in project
- [x] Use testing framework in code
- [x] Testing framework
- [SKIP] Testing in a team ?
- [SKIP] Testing indeterminate functions
- [ ] Class design ?
- [ ] Has-a relationship ?
- [ ] Built-in data structures
- [ ] Expressive data types
- [x] Create package in CI script
- [x] Implement the project as a package
- [ ] optimisation misconceptions ?
- [ ] big-O ?
- [ ] run-time speed profile ?

Shall I directly use a testing framework in TDD?
