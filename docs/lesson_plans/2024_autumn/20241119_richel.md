# Lesson plan Autumn 2024

I need to add more examples before learners
can do the exercises to work on the learners project.

Also, I do need to discuss merge conflicts: they will
need it.

On the first day, I expected the schedule of the week to be discussed.
I will do so.

- [/] Check material: learners project exercises should
  give an idea of what to do
- [ ] Add merge conflicts
- [ ] Repeat course schedule

Time is up, will push and be happy enough about it.
