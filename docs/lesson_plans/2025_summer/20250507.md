- Date: 2025-05-07

From [the reflection on the previous day](../../reflections/2025_summer/20250506.md),
I will do:

    - [We will use the requirements that I prepared](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_summer_2025/blob/main/docs/requirements.md)
- I will go through the answers at the end of a session
