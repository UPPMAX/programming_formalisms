## Literature search on design requirements

Seems useful:

- Joshi, Shraddha, et al. "Requirements in Engineering Design: What are we teaching?." Tools and methods for competitive engineering 1.38 (2012): 1319-1326.

Seems useful:

- Fricker, Samuel A., Rainer Grau, and Adrian Zwingli. "Requirements engineering: best practice." Requirements engineering for digital health. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2014. 25-46.

Seems useful:

- Young, Ralph R. "Recommended requirements gathering practices." CrossTalk 15.4 (2002): 9-12.

Seems promising, not read yet:

- Young, Ralph R. Project requirements: a guide to best practices. Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2006.
