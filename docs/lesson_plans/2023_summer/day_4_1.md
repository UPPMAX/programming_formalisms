# Day 4 part 1

* 9:00-12:00
* Richel
* Goals:
    * Theory: good algorithms
    * Students develop together on big project
    * Form: use feature branches, use CI scripts, use code review

## 9:00-9:45 RB

* Goals:
    * Theory: algorithms

When|What
----|-------------------------
9:00|Theory: algorithms: what is good? Why? Design by contract
9:15|Practice:
9:45|Break, have a break

## 10:00-10:45 RB

* Goals:
    * Start big project

When |What
-----|-------------------------
10:00|Theory: role of `assert`, RNG, RNG seed and testing
10:15|Practice (`medium`): `flip_coin`, `roll_dice`
10:45|Break, have a break

## 11:00-11:45 RB

* Goals:
    * Theory: Combining functions, `is_prime`, `is_prime_recursion`, `is_prime_for_loop`, `is_prime_special`

When       |What
-----------|-------------------------
11:00      |Theory: combining algorithms (which ones are best?), using internal algorithms
11:15      |Practice
11:45      |End, stay around for questions

## Observables

* `owner_name/programming_formalisms_medium_project` (in groups of four)
