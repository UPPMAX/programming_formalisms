## NBIS Short Term Feedback (STF)

### Core question set information

The intention of the STF survey is to find out how participants have used the
skills and knowledge they gained through participating in the NBIS course.
The STF survey aims to provide data back to NBIS from course participants.
The survey should preferably be given by the course leader to the participants
on the last day of the course.
Some of the questions below are CORE Questions and needs to always be included
in the survey. There are also room for ADDITIONAL questions that can be
modified for respective course.

- Important Information
- Core Question Set
- Demographic Information
- Quality Metrics
- Additional Questions - Training content/information
- Additional Questions - Training logistics

### Important Information

Below are the core questions for NBIS short term feedback (STF),
which are required to be captured for all NBIS training events
from August 2018 onwards, most typically in an end-of-training-event feedback
survey (i.e. exit survey). The information and Core questions are extracted
from the ELIXIR and ELIXIR-EXCELERATE courses. Additional questions are free to
be modified to suit the course needs. The format for collecting the data is up
to each training provider, although results should be exportable to Excel
format. The core questions may be divided into two categories and will by and
large be analysed separately - both categories are required to be captured:

- Demographic information
- Quality metrics

For the demographic information questions specifically, these may be captured
either in the exit survey OR in the registration form. The exit survey should
be administered as close as possible to the end of the training event,
preferably on the last day of the course. Please add the result of the survey
to the course folder in Google Drive (NBIS Course Catalogue).

The core question set is followed by a set of Additional (suggested) questions
that training organisers might also like to ask. Please note: while the core
question set is compulsory, Course leader(s) are encouraged to ask any
additional questions for their own collection and data analysis,
should they wish.

Data formatting: Preferred column headers for each core metric are in ‘red’.
It would be very helpful for analysing the data if everyone used these column
headings when exporting the results. Please note: these descriptors are case
sensitive (e.g. use `advertised` not `Advertised`).
Also, the underscores are important! (e.g. `career_stage` is NOT the same
as `career stage`).

If possible, please name the dataset file as follows to assist with data
handling:
`YYYY-MM-DD_L/STF_Location_CourseName`, e.g. `2018-06-11_STF_Visby_RaukR`

### Core Question Set

### Section 1 - Template: NBIS Short Term Feedback (STF) survey `COURSE NAME, LOCATION, YYYY-MM-DD`

Thank you for filling the questionnaire.
It is really important to us in order to continually improve the course and the
materials we deliver. In filling the questionnaire, please keep in mind that
your comments - which are not mandatory - are especially precious.
We may share anonymised information with course presenters and developers as
well as for wider quality/impact analyses.
