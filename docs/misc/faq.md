# FAQ

The frequently asked questions, about:

- [credits](#credits): can I get university credits for this course?
- [eligibility](#eligibility), i.e. when to join the course
- [preparation](#preparation)
- [course teaching](#course-teaching),
  i.e. how the course is conducted and ideas behind it

## Credits

### Can I get University Credits for this course?

No.

We don't give formal credits for the course.
That is up to your supervisor.
You can ask for a certificate after the course that helps with the decisions.

## Eligibility

### I have never programmed before. Am I eligible?

Not yet (for your own good)!

This is not an introductory course on programming.
Learners are expected to know basic programming
concepts, such as variables and functions.

In this course, you will work together a lot.
It will be likely to be noticed that
you do not have programming experience yet,
and you may feel bad about that.
Take an introductory programming course first
and then we hope to see you here again!

### I am a non-Python programmer. Am I eligible?

Yes.

In the course, we will use Python as the workhorse language,
as most of our learners have experience with Python.

You will write code in Python in exercises.
To make that possible for non-Python programmers:

- code will be simple and/or copy-pasted
- learners are usually paired up,
  so that usually one of the learners knows Python.

## Preparation

### How do I prepare?

See [prerequisites](../prereqs.md) for how to prepare.

## Prerequisites

### How do I know I have VS Code installed?

You know if you have VS Code installed,
if you can start this program
and it looks like this:

```text
[TODO: screenshot of VS Code here]
```

#### How do I know I have a GitHub account?

You have set up a GitHub account, if you can login at
[https://github.com/](https://github.com/).


### How do I know if I have Python installed?

You have installed Python, if

```text
TODO: Add how to check in VS Code

Maybe:
In a terminal, running `python --version` or `python3 --version` shows the Python version.
```


### Can you run Python from VS Code?

Yes.

We even use VS Code to install Python,
as VS Code has an easy to install Python plugin.

### How do I know that I know the basics of Python?

You know enough basic Python, if:

- You can describe what a variable is
- You can change the value of a variable
- You can show the value of a variable on screen

If you do not know enough Python,
[chapters 1 and 2 of 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist'](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html)
is all you need.

### Why do you use VS Code?

Because it ...

- is free (as in beer)
- works on all operating systems
- has plugins that are easy to install to develop Python code as part of a Python package
- has `git` for version control built-in
- has a built-in terminal

### Can I use PyCharm? Or IDLE? Or any other IDE?

Yes.

However, we may not be able to help you with your IDE problems.

Within your IDE, you will need:

- To develop Python code as part of a Python package
- To use `git` for version control

### Some other solutions


<!--

## Install Git

**Git (specific installation may be required) and terminals are already integrated in VS Code and can be the first choice**
Otherwise follow the steps in the end of this page ([Other solutions]prereqs.md#other-solutions)!

- Version >= 2.28 would do

=== "Windows"

    There are several different ways to run the course material on a Windows computer. Neither is perhaps optimal, and the material itself has not been adapted specifically for Windows. Nevertheless, in principle everything *should* be possible to run. A few ways you could setup:

    **Git-windows with a command line and Git integrated**

    - Install Git Windows: [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/?to=/placeholder.com) (**easiest if you want to start fast and plan to work in windows environment**)

        - Follow the setup insctructions from the Windows part at [https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git-in-terminal/](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git-in-terminal/) by CodeRefinery.
        - Included will be the **Git Bash**

=== "Mac"

    - We use [the VSCode built-in terminal](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/83) to some extent
    - Choose one of your choice, the built-in or another!
    - Chances are big that you already have **git installed on your computer**.
    - You can check by running e.g. `git --version`.
        - and if it reports 2.28 or higher, then you are good.
    - If you have a very old version of git or you don't have it, install it following the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
        - You may have to do ``xcode select --install`` from the Mac terminal.

=== "Linux"

    - `git` comes installed with all Linux distributions
    - To install `git`, do `sudo apt-get install git`

## Using git in VS code

- When Git is installed you may need to restart a shell in VS code before it works.

<!--
### Using VS Code as a git editor

- This will set VS Code as the editor that Git starts.
- It will start a new tab, and Git will wait until you save and close that tab.
- Git for Windows on Windows may automatically set this if you select it as an editor.
- Otherwise:

```console
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
-->

!!! info

    Go back to [checkpoints](prereqs.md#checkpoints)


### Configure git

**This must be done**

Follow these instructions. [https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/course_2104/setup/#installing-git](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/course_2104/setup/#installing-git)

!!! info

    Go back to [checkpoints](prereqs.md#checkpoints)

### GitHub

Sign up for GitHub account: [https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/github/](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/github/)

!!! info

    Go back to [checkpoints](prereqs.md#checkpoints)

### Gitâ€“GitHub connection through ssh keys

(This may take a while to get working, but is worth it)
[https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/)

- Test: `ssh -T git@github.com`
    - Output should be something like this: ``Hi bclaremar! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.``
- If not working, these are the approximate steps to be done in your terminal. It can vary between systems, so link above is more certain.

```console
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<email address for your GitHub account>"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
# Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard. For WINDOWS:
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

- On Mac, use ``pbcopy`` instead, like:

```console
# Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard. For MAC:
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```


- Then go to your GitHub account on the web.

    1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
    2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.
    3. Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.
    4. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal laptop, you might call this key "Personal laptop".
    5. Select the type of key **authentication**.
    6. In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
    7. Click Add SSH key.
    8. If prompted, confirm access to your account on GitHub.

- Now test again in your terminal: `ssh -T git@github.com`
    - Output should be something like this: ``Hi bclaremar! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.``

- If there was a problem, confer the full article [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

## Python

- Use what you already have
- If you don't have Python there are different ways to go. We won't use Conda during the lessons, for instance.
    - Bare python (recommended for the **"bare metal" user**)
        - You may need to install other packages (pip)
        - [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - **note macOS**: the system install of Python on macOS is not supported, instead:
            - ``brew install python3``
    - Anaconda (recommended for **python/R developers liking GUI:s**)
        - **Count with 15-20 minutes**
        - includes
            - many many packages
            - conda packager
            - pip installer
            - GUI launchers, like example
            - jupyter notebook/lab
            - Spyder
            - RStudio
            - etc...
        - [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
    - miniconda (recommended for **terminal user**)
        - **Faster to install**
        - Includes:
            - less packages than Anaconda, and no GUI launcher but:
            - conda packager
            - pip installer
            - etc...
        - [install Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/)

- In Linux and Bash, Python should work from the command line by typing ``python``/``python3`` or running a script with ``python <script>``/``python3 <script>``

## Python in VS Code

- Step 1. Install a supported version of Python on your system, see above.
- Step 2. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code from the left menu bar.
- Step 3. Open or create a Python file and start coding.
    - Example: make a hello.py script and run it with the "play" button.
    - Choose which Python interpreter to use.
- Step 4. To run Python from a VS Code terminal (Bash or other) you may have to restart the shell

## Python courses

- We assume familiarity with python at least equivalent
- Learn the basics by choosing one or several of these  courses!

    - [Python part](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/) of the UPPMAX introductory course
    - [Python programming with applications to bioinformatics](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/85913).

## Other solutions

There are some other solutions for installations but they are probably not supported by the teachers of the course.

### Terminals

=== "Windows"

    There are several different ways to run the course material on a Windows computer. Neither is perhaps optimal, and the material itself has not been adapted specifically for Windows. Nevertheless, in principle everything *should* be possible to run. A few ways you could setup:

    **Git-windows with a command line and Git integrated**

    - Install Git Windows: [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/?to=/placeholder.com) (**easiest if you want to start fast and plan to work in windows environment**)

        - Included will be the **Git Bash**

    **Other possibilities**

    - Use the **Windows 10 PowerShell**
        - [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A:-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-PowerShell)
    - Use the Linux Bash Shell (**WSL**) on Windows 10/11 (**perhaps best practice if you plan to run Linux as well**)
        - This will give you access to a full command-line bash shell based on Linux on your Windows 10/11 PC.
        - instructions below
        - For the difference between the Linux Bash Shell and the PowerShell on Windows 10, see *e.g.* [this article](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/On-Windows-PowerShell-vs-Bash-comparison-gets-interesting).
    - Run as Linux through a **virtual machine** (and see the Linux setup above)
        - not shown

    **Install Bash on Windows 10/11 (WSL)**, following the instructions at *e.g.* **1** of these resources:

    - [Installing the Windows Subsystem and the Linux Bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
    - [Installing and using Linux Bash on Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)
    - [Installing Linux Bash on Windows](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/)

### Python from In Git-bash (Windows)

- Get it working from **Git Bash**
    - if the command ``type python`` gives you a path, then proceed
        - otherwise you may have to do a new installation
        - or find the path
        - if anaconda installation you may add something like this:
        - ``echo 'export PATH="<path/to/Anaconda/root>:<path/to/anaconda/root>/Scripts:$PATH:' >> .bashrc``
            - example:  ``/c/Users/bjcar425/AppData/Local/anaconda3:/c/Users/bjcar425/AppData/Local/anaconda3/Scripts``
    - ``$ alias python='winpty python.exe'``
    - ``$ python -V``
        - does it give you the python version 3-something?
- Make it permanent
 -``$ echo "alias python='winpty python.exe'" >> ~/.bashrc``

### How do I know I have a good Zoom setup?

You have a Zoom good setup, if:

- you can talk freely. If not, find a room/place where you can.
- others in the Zoom room can clearly hear what you say.
  If not, use a microphone.
- you can clearly hear what others in the Zoom room say.
  If not, use a headset.


### Do I really need a good Zoom setup?

Yes.

You will be working together with other learners a lot.
Not being able to talk and/or share your screen and/or
your camera is likely to make you feel excluded.
