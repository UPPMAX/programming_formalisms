# FAQ

The frequently asked questions, about:

- [credits](#credits): can I get university credits for this course?
- [eligibility](#eligibility), i.e. when to join the course
- [preparation](#preparation)
- [course teaching](#course-teaching),
  i.e. how the course is conducted and ideas behind it

## Credits

### Can I get University Credits for this course?

No.

We don't give formal credits for the course.
That is up to your supervisor.
You can ask for a certificate after the course that helps with the decisions.

## Eligibility

### I have never programmed before. Am I eligible?

Not yet (for your own good)!

This is not an introductory course on programming.
Learners are expected to know basic programming
concepts, such as variables and functions.

In this course, you will work together a lot.
It will be likely to be noticed that
you do not have programming experience yet,
and you may feel bad about that.
Take an introductory programming course first
and then we hope to see you here again!

### I am a non-Python programmer. Am I eligible?

Yes.

In the course, we will use Python as the workhorse language,
as most of our learners have experience with Python.

You will write code in Python in exercises.
To make that possible for non-Python programmers:

- code will be simple and/or copy-pasted
- learners are usually paired up,
  so that usually one of the learners knows Python.

## Preparation

### How do I prepare?

See [prerequisites](../prereqs.md) for how to prepare.

### Do I really need a good Zoom setup?

Yes.

You will be working together with other learners a lot.
Not being able to talk and/or share your screen and/or
your camera is likely to make you feel excluded.

### Do I really need a git SSH key?

No.

But is is thought of to be quite convenient :-)

## Course teaching

### What is the goal of the shared project?

See [Projects](../project/README.md) for the goal of the shared project.

### How is the course prepared?

- meetings

- general lesson plans, which can be found at
  ['Misc } lesson_plans'](../lesson_plans/README.md)
  of this GitHub repository

### What happens to the retrospectives?

Retrospectives are:

- published online in unedited form at
  [the 'Misc | evaluations' section](evaluations.md)
  of this GitHub repository
- discussed by the teachers after the lessons
- reflected upon, where the reflections can be found in
  [at 'Misc | Reflections'](../reflections/README.md)

### Why do you publish your retrospectives?

Because we like to be transparent.

### What happens to the evaluations?
