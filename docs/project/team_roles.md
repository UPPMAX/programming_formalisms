# Team roles

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Understand there are different roles in a team
    - Signal our interest in a role

???- question "For teachers"

    Prerequisites are:

    - .

    Teaching goals are:

    - .

    Prior:

    - .

    Lesson plans:

      Feedback 1: feedback_1, after exercise_1, 5s
      Theory 2: theory_2, after feedback_1, 5s
      Exercise 2: crit, exercise_2, after theory_2, 10s
      Exercise 2 after the break: crit, after exercise_2, 5s
    ```

There are multiple team roles and people can have multiple
roles.

Here are some roles we informally use in this project:

## Product owner

A product owner determines what the software needs to do.
In the industry, this is typically a (representative of a) customer.
In this course, the product owner is an imaginary
professor that want to write a simulation to be used
in writing a research paper.

The product owner is the person that needs to be made happy.
He/she cares about correctness, but not about the actual implementation.

## Issue manager

An issue manager:

- checks issues for duplicates
- closes issues when no longer needed, 'have gone stale'
- creates issues when needed
- checks that all team members are assigned to an issue

## Software architect

A software architect:

- decides upon the architecture of the software

## Data manager

A data manager:

- decides upon the format of the data

## Lead developer

A lead developer:

- end responsible for the whole team
- likely to discuss progress with the product owner

## Experience-based roles

### Newbie developer

Team members that just started.
They need to be taught the workflow by junior developers.

### Junior developer

A junior developers:

- fixes the tests written by mediors
- teaches the workflow to newbies

### Medior developer

A medior developer:

- creates issues that contain a test
- does code reviews

### Senior developer

A senior developer:

- see the bigger picture of the code and the team
- works on more complex issues, such as improving the architecture of
  the code or improving the continuous integration tools

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: signal your experience

We all have different skill levels.
In a normal setting, we would have had time to
find out everyone's skill level.
In this course, however, we take a ruthless shortcut.
We do so, so that the more experienced developers
are likelier to get tasks that suit their level.

Do so by modifying the README file in the course project,
assign yourself a skill level, by adding your name in the right row
of the table with experience levels.

When unsure, pick 'junior'.

### Exercise 2: signal a role you want to practice

There are many roles in a team and you may fulfill multiple.

If you are interested in being any of these below, let the teachers
know and you'll be assigned the role if (still) vacant.

- Issue manager
- Product owner
- Software architect
- Data manager
- Lead developer

Do so by modifying the README file in the course project,
by adding your name in the right row of the table with roles.

When unsure, do not fill in your name and be 'just' a developer :-)
