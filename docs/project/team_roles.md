# Team roles

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Understand there are different roles in a team
    - Signal our interest in a role

There are multiple team roles and people can have multiple
roles.

Here are some roles we informally use in this project:

## Product owner

A product owner determines what the software needs to do.
In the industry, this is typically a (representative of a) customer.
In this course, the product owner is an imaginary
professor that want to write a simulation to be used
in writing a research paper.

The product owner is the person that needs to be made happy.
He/she cares about correctness, but not about the actual implementation.

## Issue manager

An issue manager:

- checks issues for duplicates
- closes issues when no longer needed, 'have gone stale'
- creates issues when needed
- checks that all team members are assigned to an issue

## Software architect

A software architect:

- decides upon the architecture of the software

## Data manager

A data manager:

- decides upon the format of the data

## Lead developer

A lead developer:

- end responsible for the whole team
- likely to discuss progress with the product owner

## Experience-based roles

### Newbie developer

They need to be taught the workflow by junior developers.

### Junior developer
