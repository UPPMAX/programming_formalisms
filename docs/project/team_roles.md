# Team roles

There are multiple team roles and people can have multiple
roles.

Here are some roles we informally use in this project:

## Product owner

A product owner determines what the software needs to do.
In the industry, this is typically a (representative of a) customer.
In this course, the product owner is an imaginary
professor that want to write a simulation to be used
in writing a research paper.

The product owner is the person that needs to be made happy.
He/she cares about correctness, but not about the actual implementation.

- decides upon the architecture of the software

## Data manager

A data manager:

## Lead developer

A lead developer:

- end responsible for the whole team
- likely to discuss progress with the product owner

## Newbie developer

Team members that just started.
They need to be taught the workflow by junior developers.

## Junior developer

A junior developers:

- fixes the tests written by mediors
- teaches the workflow to newbies

## Medior developer

A medior developer:

- creates issues that contain a test

  the code or improving the continuous integration tools
