# Project workflow

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - To be a good team member within a project
    - Use Issues to communicate what needs to be done
    - Assign yourself to Issues to communicate what you are working on
    - Use a kanban board to get an overview of what is actively being worked on
    - Use a kanban board to communicate what you are working on now

An example of good Project usage: all team members present are
assigned to an Issue. All Issues that are actively worked 
worked on are in 'In Progress'.
