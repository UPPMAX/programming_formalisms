# Project

In this course, we work together on a project:

**[The Programming Formalisms Autumn 2024 learners' project](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_autumn_2024)**.

The goal of having a project is to provide a situation in which the theory is
experienced. For example, at the start, merging code together will give
some troubles. Later in the course, we learn how to avoid these troubles.
Making the learners experience which problems are solved by
using professional workflows is the reason of having one project.

A worked-out example project can be found
[here](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_example_project).

## Exercises

These exercises are about working on the shared project.
The current project, as well as earlier shared projects,
