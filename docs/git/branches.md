# Git branches

!!! questions

    - How to not ruin working code when adding new features?
    - How to work on parallel tracks (many developers, versions)?
    - How to fix mistakes?

!!! info "Learning outcomes of 'Branches'"

    - learners can

        - explain and evaluate the usefulness of branches
        - create, switch and delete a `git` branch locally


???- note "Instructor notes"

    Prerequisites are:

    - git basics

    Lesson Plan:

    - **Total** 50 min
    - Theory 20
    - Exercise 20
    - Discussions 10 min

???- admonition "Changes"

    - clearer guide
    - ask about level
    - If possible simplify things even further, or expand on rationale behind each step not just "big picture"
    - practical examples than just explain the concept.
    - more practical examples of git forking and branching and when it is appropriate to use them.
    - exercises
        - practical things within exercise (not needing to scroll back and forth)
        - clearer instructions
        - advanced exercises

    - Give more practical examples of git branching and when it is appropriate to use them.
    - Git branch couple to SDLC

## Branching and merging

Software development is often not linear:

- We typically need at least one version of the code to "work" (to compile, to give expected results, ...).
- At the same time we work on new features, often several features concurrently.
  Often they are unfinished.
- We need to be able to separate different lines of work really well.

![Isolated tracks](../img/git-collaborative.svg){width: 50%}
_Isolated tracks of work._

The strength of version control is that it permits the researcher to **isolate
different tracks of work**, which can later be merged to create a composite
version that contains all changes.

- We see branching points and merging points.
- Main line development is often called `master` or `main`.
- Other than this convention there is nothing special about `master` or `main`, it is just a branch.

- A group of commits that create a single narrative are called a **branch**.
- There are different branching **strategies**, but it is useful to think that a branch tells the **story of a feature**, e.g. "fast sequence extraction" or "Python interface" or "fixing bug in matrix inversion algorithm".

!!! note "Three ways to name a branch"

    - Issues: #45: Concrete examples
    - Features: GUI module
    - Personal: BjÃ¶rn

### Typical workflows

One typical workflow:

- create branch
- switch to it
- work, work, work, ..., and test
- add and commit
- once feature is ready, switch back to main
- make clear which branch you are in
- merge new-feature to present branch
- remove branch

In VS Code

- Here is where you handle branches

![branches in VS Code](../img/branch_section_VSC.png)

- Click and you have the possibility to
    - create a new branch

    ![create branch in VS Code](../img/create_branch_VSC.png)

    - and switch between existing branches
  
    ![switch branch in VS Code](../img/switch_branch_VSC.png)

???- admonition "In command line"

```console
git branch new-feature  # create branch, switch to it
git add/commit                   # work, work, work, ..., and test
git switch master          # once feature is ready, switch back to master
git branch                   # make clear which branch you are in
git merge new-feature        # merge work to present branch
git branch -d new-feature    # remove branch
```

### Git graph

- We can get an overview of graphs

- GitHub

   Link to last year

- VS Code

  - **Image here**


???- tip "Graph alias in command line"

    **An important alias**

    - We can define an _alias_ in Git, to be able to nicely visualize branch structure in the terminal without having to remember a long Git command.

    ```console
    git config --global alias.graph "log --all --graph --decorate --oneline"
    ```

    This will enable you to use ``git graph`` for short

    !!! example
    
        ```git

        $ git graph
        * 000b440 (HEAD -> main) rm print
        | * 4d4acaf (modularity) 4 modular files
        |/
        | * 2d4e252 (jupiter) add jupiter
        |/
        * b9465e4 (origin/main) planet.py documentation
        * 6a416b5 add folders and planet code

        ```

        ```mermaid
        gitGraph

        commit id: "add folders and planet code"
        commit id: "add planet.py documentation"
        branch jupiter
        checkout jupiter
        commit id: "add jupiter"
        checkout main
        branch modular
        checkout modular
        commit id: "4 modular files"
        checkout main
        commit id: "rm print"

        ```

!!! tip "Show unstaged/uncommitted modifications"

    - When you are done editing the files, try `git diff`:

    ```console
    git diff
    ```

    - You can use _arrows_ or _enter_ to scroll the output and quit with ``q``.
    - You will see some things like this.

    ???- "Output from 'diff'"

        ```diff
        diff --git a/ingredients.txt b/ingredients.txt
        index 4422a31..ba8854f 100644

!!! tip "git push doesn't work with new branch"

    - you always have to pull before a push:

    ```git
    git pull #
    ```

    - You may need to be more detailed:

    ```git
    git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
    ```

## Exercises

!!! tip "Have VS code side-by-side with GitHub window"

### Exercise 1: create, switch and delete a `git` branch

???- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Create, switch and delete a `git` branch
    - Build up experience using git without troubleshooting

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Before start"
    commit id: "Branching version"
    branch sven
    checkout sven
    commit id: "Modify my file"
    commit id: "Delete branch" type: HIGHLIGHT
    checkout main
    commit id: "Another commit"
```

- For our shared **GitHub repository**, create a branch with your first name that is
  unique, e.g. `sven`, `sven_svensson` or `sven_svensson_314`.
  You may branch of from `main` or `develop` (if it exists).
  You may use the web interface (easiest!) or use VS Code


-** On your local computer:**
    - update the repository (pull)
    - switch to the new branch
    - change the content of the repository, for example,
      by creating a file in `learners/[your_name]/[your_name]_is_on_[your_branch_name]`
    - push your changes online.
- On **GitHub**, verify that your changes on your branch can be found online
- On your **local computer**, switch to the main branch,
  as we'll delete the branch you are on now
- Delete your branch (i.e. the one with the unique name).
  You may use the web interface (easiest!) or use the VS Code
- On your local computer, update your code (pull)

    ![github_create_branch_annotated](github_create_branch_annotated.png)

    Click on 1, type your branch name at 2 (in this case, `richel`), then click 3.
    Done!

    > - On your local computer:
    >     - update the repository

    On your **local computer**, navigate to the folder of the shared project
    and update:

    ![branches in VS Code](../img/branch_section_VSC.png)

    ![switch branch in VS Code](../img/switch_branch_VSC.png)
  
    ???- admonition "command line"
    
        ```git
        git pull
        ```

    > - On your local computer:
    >     - switch to the new branch

    Switch to the new branch, for example, `richel`, by doing:

    ```git
    git switch richel
    ```

    > - On your local computer:
    >     - change the content of the repository, for example,
    >       by creating a file in `learners/[your_name]/[your_name]_is_on_[your_branch_name]`

    This can be any change you'd like.
    To create a file under Linux (and maybe this works on other
    operating systems too), one can do:

    ```git
    touch learners/richel/richel_is_on_richel.txt
    ```

    After the change, commit these:

    ```git
    git add .
    git commit -m "Richel is on richel"
    ```

    > - On your local computer:
    >     - push your changes online.

    Do:

    ```git
    git push
    ```

    And your code may end up online.

    If that does not work, do:

    ```git
    git pull
    ```

    and try pushing again, maybe multiple times, as many people
    are pushing to the shared repo.

    > - On GitHub, verify that your changes on your branch can be found online

    ![github_pushed_to_branch](github_pushed_to_branch.png)

    Make sure you look at the correct branch, as displayed at 1.
    Then your commit message shows up at 2.

    > - On your local computer, switch to the main branch,
    >   as we'll delete the branch you are on now

    Switch to the main branch, for example, `main`, by doing:

    ```git
    git switch main
    ```

    > - Delete your branch (i.e. the one with the unique name).
    >   You may use the web interface (easiest!) or use the command line

    ![github_view_branches_annotated](github_view_branches_annotated.png)

    Click on 'Branches', as shown in the image above.

    ![github_view_all_branches_annotated](github_view_all_branches_annotated.png)

    Click on garbage bin, as shown in the image above.

    ![github_view_all_branches_just_deleted_annotated](github_view_all_branches_just_deleted_annotated.png)

    The branch will now be deleted, as shown in the image above.

    > - On your local computer, update your code

    Do:

    ```git
    git pull
    ```

## Summary

- Now we know how to save snapshots:

```git
git add <file(s)>
git commit
```

- And that is what we do as we program.
- Other very useful commands are these:

```git
git init    # initialize new repository
git add     # add files or stage file(s)
git commit  # commit staged file(s)
git status  # see what is going on
git log     # see history
git diff    # show unstaged/uncommitted modifications
git show    # show the change for a specific commit
git switch -b wild-idea    # create branch, switch to it, work, work, work ...
git switch main          # realize it was a bad idea, back to main/master
git branch -D wild-idea      # it is gone, off to a new idea
git merge
```

    - Donât be afraid to stage and commit often. Better too o
    - A branch is a division unit of work, to be merged with
    - A tag is a pointer to a moment in the history of a proj
    - A repository can have one or multiple remotes (we will
    - Local branches often track remote branches.
    - A remote serves as a full backup of your work.
