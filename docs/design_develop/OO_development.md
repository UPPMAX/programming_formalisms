# Object Oriented development

>People regard their environment in terms of objects"
`[Jacobson 1992]`

???- info "Learning objectives"
    - Understand what a Design Pattern is 
    - Describe the general components of design patterns and their significance.

???- info "Learning objectives of Design Patterns"

    - The learners know of the "zero line" code and how it relates to software design "Zero line" Design
    - The learners can describe the general parts of a design pattern and why we use them.
    - The Learners should be able to understand the "Factory pattern" and what problem it solves
    

This leads to a smaller semantic gap which
gives two major benefits
    -Understanding
        the semantic gap(The distance form input to understanding) between reality and model is smaller making the risk of misunderstanding less.
    - Modification
        The model tends to be local resulting from a individual item. Each of these are represented by a single object.


### Objects
!!! info What is and object
    An object is an entity that is defined by being able to save state(Information) and a number of operations(Behavior).

!!! info **Object Orientation is a Paradigm not a language feature**
    - Mariam-webster defines a Paradigm as:
    philosophical and theoretical framework of a scientific school or discipline within which theories, laws, and generalizations and the experiments performed in support of them are formulated
    - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy cites the work of Thomas Kuhn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in where a work of Paradigm is not only the key theories and laws, but also—and this is what makes them paradigms—the applications of those theories in the solution of important problems



Developing object orientated is following these principles

1: Information Hiding
    No unit outside of the object shall know the internal workings of the object
2: The concept of Encapsulation

3: The concept of message passing
