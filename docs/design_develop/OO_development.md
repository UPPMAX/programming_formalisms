# Object Oriented development

>People regard their environment in >terms of objects"
`[Jacobson 1992]`

This leads to a smaller semantic gap which
gives two major benefits
    -Understanding
    - Modification

!!! info **Object Orientation is a Paradigm not a language feature**
    - A paradigm is a set of rules that informs your thinking while

Developing object orientated is following these principles

1: Information Hiding
    No unit outside of the object shall know the internal workings of the object
2: The concept of Encapsulation

3: The concept of message passing
