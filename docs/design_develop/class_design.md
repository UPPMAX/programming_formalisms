# Object Oriented devlopment

**Object Orientation is a Pardigm not a language feature**
Developing objecto orientated is following three principles
1: Information Hiding
    No unit outside of the object shall know the internal wokings of the object
2: The concept of Encapsulation

3: The concept of message passing
