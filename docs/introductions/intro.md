# Introduction

## What is software?
*Wikipedia*
- set of computer programs and associated documentation and data.
- This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work. 
- **User-written software: End-user development**
  - Users create this software themselves and _often overlook how important it may be to others_.

### Some software concepts
- program
- script (directly interpreted at run time)
- tool
- model
- application
---

```{admonition} Scripting vs programming
  - **Python** is an **interpreted language**.
    - Python uses an interpreter to translate and run its code. Hence Python is a **scripting language**.
  - Programs written in **C++** are **compiled** and then the compiled code runs to generate the output.
    - Hence, C++ is  a **programming language** and not a scripting language, since scripting languages are directly interpreted at run time and no prior compilation of the code takes place.
---

```{Note}
   We will not be very definite in the course in when to use scripting, program or tools 
```

### Outcome of a Program
- **Correct**
  - and _flawless_
- **Efficient**
  - _Utilize_ the computer system's resources
- **Reusable**
  - Finished _components_
  - Lower _development_ _costs_
  - _Faster_
  - Higher _quality_
  - _packaging_ technology
- **Changeable**
  - _Maintenance_ cost
    - Fix errors, bugs
    - Adapt to _new requirements_
    - Independent _modules_
    - Encapsulation/_information hiding_
   

## Code Example???
   
## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- We need a workflow in our programming projects!

### Some common steps 

- Planning
  - Analysis and design
- Development
  - Source control
  - Algorithms
  - In-code documentation
  - Optimization
    - Parallelism
- Test
- Development and maintenance
  - Documentation
  - Reproducibility and sharing
--- 
- ... and **Iterations**
---
### Agile development
  - Division of tasks into **short phases of work** and frequent **re-assessment** and adaptation of plans.

## Summary of Introduction
- Now after the overview you are ready to dig deeper in the topics and try it out yourself!

```{Keypoints}
- A program shall be or have content/components that is:
  - Correct
  - Efficient
  - Reusable
  - Changeable

- Software development is both series of steps: 
     1.	Requirements
     2.	Analysis and design
     3.	Development
     4.	Test
     5.	Development and maintenance
- ... and iteration of these

```
