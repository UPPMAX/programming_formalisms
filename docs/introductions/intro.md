# Introduction

!!! info "Content"

    We start with a more **theoretical introduction** covering software and mindsets for software development.


!!! info "Learning outcomes of 'Introduction'"

    Learners can

    - Identify the main topics and objectives for the week's lessons.
    - Evaluate the importance of engaging with course content and identify
      strategies to maintain interest and motivation throughout the week.

???- note "Instructor notes"

    Prerequisites are:

    The [pre-requirements](../prereqs.md):

    - Learners know basic Python
    - Learners have installed necessary tools

    Teaching goals are:

    - Learners can can understand why a formalized development of software
      is important.

    Lesson Plan:

    - **Total** 20 min
    - Theory 10
    - Discussions 10 min

???- info "TOC"

    - What is software?
        - software concepts
        - types
        - outcome
            - correct, reusable, efficient, changable
    - Example
    - Software Development Life Cycle

???- admonition "Changes"

    - clear goal
    - clearer guide
    - ask about level
    - If possible simplify things even further, or expand on rationale behind each step not just "big picture"
    - practical examples than just explain the concept.
    - **dictionary**
    - exercises
        - clearer instructions
        - solutions
        - (advanced exercises)


## Different types of Scientific software

???- admonition "Analysis of data"

    - statistics
    - figures
    - visualization

???- admonition "tools for process data"

    - refining data (formatting)

???- admonition "Workflows"

    - automate several steps
        - many scripts doing different things but alltogether creating a result)

???- admonition "Modelling (mimic the reality)"

    - mathematical models of relationships among variables in a system
    - simulations time-varying behaviour of a system

???- admonition "Decision assistance"

???- admonition "Other?"

!!! discussion

    **What do you develop for?**

## Outcome of a Program

- **Correct**
    - and *flawless*
- **Efficient**
    - *Utilize* the computer system's resources
- **Reusable**
    - Finished *components*
    - Lower *development* *costs*
    - *Faster*
    - Higher *quality*
    - *packaging* technology
- **Changeable**
    - *Maintenance* cost
        - Fix errors, bugs
        - Adapt to *new requirements*
        - Independent *modules*
        - Encapsulation/*information hiding*

## Common problems

!!! quote "We want"

    - **Correctness**
    - **Efficiency**
    - **Reusability**
    - **Changeabilitye**
    - And **Readability**

- Can other people **use** your code?
- Do you or anyone else **understand** your code at a later moment?
- Does it work for **all cases**?
- Is is easy to **find** when and where the **code broke**?
- Is it easy to **make changes** in one part without ruin the rest of the program?
- Does is use the resources **efficiently**?
- Is is easy to use a part of the program in another program?
- Can the program be run on different platforms
    - like Linux/Max/Windows,
    - like different hardware architectures (intel, amd, arm)

??? question "How can we make it easier to get good software and usefulness?"

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- We need a workflow in our programming projects!

!!! info "Phases defined in `[Perry, 2000]`, pages 148-149:"

    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Program
    - Test
    - Installation
    - Maintain

### Alternative phases

- **Planning**
    - Analysis (with *requirements*) and *design*
- **Development** â€” the *programming*
    - Source control
    - Algorithms
    - In-code documentation
    - Optimization
        - Parallelism
    - *Tests*
- **Deployment** (or *installation* and **maintenance**)
    - Documentation
    - Reproducibility and sharing
    - Packaging and dependencies

- ... and **Iterations**

- Agile development
    - Division of tasks into **short phases of work** and frequent **re-assessment** and adaptation of plans.

!!! info "Definitions"

    - Want [explanations and definitions](../misc/definitions.md) of the technical terms in the course?

???- challenge "Can you connect the the phases above with what we ask of a program"

     Discuss in groups

    - **Correctness**
    - **Efficiency**
    - **Reusability**
    - **Changeabilitye**
    - And **Readability**

## Summary of Introduction

- Now after the overview you are ready to dig deeper about the tools!

!!! abstract "Keypoints"

    - A program shall be or have content/components that is:
        - Correct
        - Efficient
        - Reusable
        - Changeable

    - Software development is both series of steps:

        - Requirements
        - Design
        - Program
        - Test
        - Installation
        - Maintain

    - ... and iteration of these

!!! info "Learning outcomes of 'Introduction'"

    Learners can

    - Identify the main topics and objectives for the week's lessons.
    - Evaluate the importance of engaging with course content and identify
      strategies to maintain interest and motivation throughout the week.
