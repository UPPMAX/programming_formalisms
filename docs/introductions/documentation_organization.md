    - run-all script and/or main program (also related to software)
    - files
        - README
    - namings


## Documentation

!!! admonition "Documentation comes in different forms"

    - What *is* documentation?
        - **Tutorials**: learning-oriented, allows the newcomer to get started
        - **How-to guides**: goal-oriented, shows how to solve a specific problem
        - **Explanation**: understanding-oriented, explains a concept
        - **Reference**: information-oriented, describes the machinery
        - **In-code documentaion â€” docstrings**
        **Not to forget**
        - Project documentation:
            - requirements: what is the goal of the software, risks, platforms
            - the analysis: pseudocode and UML
            - risk analysis

**There is no one size fits all**: often for small projects a `README.md` or
`README.rst` can be enough (more about these formats later).
