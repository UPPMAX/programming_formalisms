## Meeting after course

- [Richel, discuss] How many things at the same time should our learners do?
    - B: ceil(\pi - e)
    - L:
    - R: 1
- [Richel, discuss] What should the learners do in the break?
    - B: break or technical issues if OK with them
    - L:
    - R: do nothing, take a break
- [Richel, discuss] How long should a monologue be? What should happen when this duration has been  crossed?
    - B: aim to 10 minutes
        - is a demo where they can choose to do a type-along a monologue?
        - with demo it can be up to 20 I guess
    - L:
    - R: 20 minutes max, a helper should remind the teacher by voice
