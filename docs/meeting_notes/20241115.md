# Programming Formalisms meeting 2024-11-15

## Agenda

- Anyone need help?
    - RB: No
- RB: FYI: I am always present and always able to teach something.
  One example: when we discuss `git`, I can take the learners
  that already know `git` to a separate room and get them working
  on the project already. Just set me to work!
