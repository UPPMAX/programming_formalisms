## Course project

[students] R: simulating bacterial movement in 2D space
[selves!]  M: N-body simulation, e.g. galaxy sim or predator-prey
Marcus and Richel will write a project breef that Lars Formalises.
The [selves!] project has a Requierments modeleling and a first usecasemodel done, Next step is to create modules and classes to solve the structure problem. as well as describing the testcases in more detail for each use case-requierment.
