## Remove obsolete files

Currently, we only use our MkDocs pages.
This means PDFs and Powerpoint presentations
are obsolete.

Here is a list of such obsolete files:

```text
./development_design/Modular_Programming.pdf
./development_design/Development and Programming Formalisms vt2023.pdf
./development_design/Development_and_Programming_Formalisms.pdf
./development_design/development_and_programming_formalisms_ht2023.pdf
./development_design/ZoomWhiteboard.pdf
./development_design/img/AI_assisted_No_UU_logo.pptx
./development_design/analysis_and_design_programming_formalism_ht_2023.pdf
./common_practices/slides/notes_code_review.pdf
./img/development_design/AI_assisted_No_UU_logo.pptx
```

I suggest to delete all these
