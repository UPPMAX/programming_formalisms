        - Day 1: Björn, Björn, Jon
        - Day 2: Lars, Jon, Richel
        - Day 3: Richel, Richel, Jon
        - Day 4: Richel, Richel, Jon
        - Day 5: Lars (design patterns), Richel (prep with Marcus), Anon (ask Nina, R will recruit!) feedback like Python
- Design documents: L plans to be done Friday 23:59
- Retrospectives
- Changes to schedule
- Lesson preparation:
    - Talk max 20 mins, then monitor students
- Advertise (NAISS newsletter next Thurs)
    - update present
    - material is language agnostic, we do use git and Python for exercises (done in pairs)
    - prepare:
        - git+little python
        - Refer to the UPPMAX git course, last years' website: <https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/events/courses/2022/introduction-to-git>
        - Refer to the NBIS Python course, <https://github.com/nbisweden/workshop-python/tree/ht23>

            Programming Formalisms Course - Nov 27- Dec 1 (online)

            This full 5-day course aims to give scientists, bioinformaticians and other research engineers  with some experience in programming and scripting an understanding of the underlying principles of software development, design, and programming. The course aims to strengthen the understanding of more advanced programming concepts, ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular programming and to enable a better understanding of how to evaluate a script or programs performance.

            We will cover an introduction to Algorithms and Data structures, Programming Paradigms especially structured and object oriented programming, and to give an overview of other paradigms like functional programming. Modular development and (code) reusability, testing and optimisation.

            We will cover theory with bridging practical examples and applications to enhance the theoretical understanding of the principles. The material is language agnostic, we do use git and Python for exercises

            Recommended knowledge of Git and programming in Python equivallent of either NBIS/ELIXIR-SE Tools for Reproducible research or
            <https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/> (material still availible)
            We assume familiarity with python atleast equivallent of the python part of the UPPMAX indroductiory course or Python programming with applications to bioinformatics <https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/85913>.
For more information and registration, please visit: `[broken URL to UPPMAX Programming Formalisms announcement]`.


- Date for precourse setup
    - Friday Nov 24 10:00-11:00 Programming Formalism Drop-in: B, L, R will be there (learners in Tools for Reproducible Research already use git and Python)

## TODOs

- [X] R: inform NBIS Training Steering group of our planned course
