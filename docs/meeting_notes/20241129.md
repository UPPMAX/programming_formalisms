# Meeting 2024-11-29

Goal: to determine what needs to be discussed in future meetings.
If we know what to do, we can agree on doing those things.

- R: suggest: for next time, we should have all gone through the issues
  and give our opinions on those we are assigned to.
  E.g.:
    - I ask ask BC for advice, so I assign it
    - BC gives advice, then unassigns

Next meeting in two weeks:

- Monday Dec 16 11:00, we'll discuss the issues
