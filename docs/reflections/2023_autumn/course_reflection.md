# Course reflection autumn 2023

Here I reflect on the course as a whole,
starting with my own thoughts, than using
the Retrospective.

I think the course is moving in the
right direction: I have spent multiple
hours with Jon and Lars to align our course
ideas, which achieved exactly that goal.

I regret the lack of exercises in the earlier
days, which caused me to do catch-up in
mine. I have -and should!- taken the hit
for the team, at the cost of deepening my
own materials. I need to make a list
of exercises the learners need to have done
on the other days. Here goes:

* Become a member of the GitHub team. Goals:
   (1) to make sure all learners have a GitHub
   account, (2) to make sure all learners
   can work on the shared repo
* Do a basic git workflow from the
   command-line. Goal: to make sure all
   learners can actually push to the shared
   repo: there will be things that don't work
   smoothly
* Do a git workflow with branches from the
   command-line. Goal: the make sure learners
   can work with branches and understand what
   'a pull request from a topic branch to
   develop, by code review' means
* Put a use-case diagram of the shared project
   on the repository. Goal: to allow the
   learners to make a class diagram
* Put the class diagram of the shared project
   on the repository. Goal: this allows the
   learners to start programming the classes
   at the same time

The idea of gradually building up
a shared repo seems The Dream to me:
starting from informal development to
formal.

The order of lectures and exercises can
be improved. If I would be boss:

* Pair programming first: this is the basis
   of everything; helps form
   a learning community (note I would like to
   have formal project roles!)
* Basic git workflow and getting a
   use case diagram early
* Do the social code review after having
   practiced with branches
* Class design after algorithms are
   programmed to work on the data structures
* Do design patterns after classes have
   been programmed

Or: as teachers, agree on exercises to be done,
not which content is discussed.

Except for these points, spending some
more time with the course material will
improve the course.

Let's see what the learners thought ...

## What went well?

* Pair programming +3
* Provided an opportunity for more social programming, including working
  in a live github repository where other people are working +1
* Good level of social interaction +1
* chatting during breaks +1
* Time for questions and answers

It seems the social part of the course
was appreciated strongly :-)

* Lots of exercises +2

Same as last year: indeed, more exercises
would be better :-)

* Hand-on demos that can be used in the future +3
* teachers are enthusiastic and seem to know what they're talking about
* Well experienced teachers +1
* providing references

It is nice to hear we teachers seems to be
competent.

* Frequent breaks +3

My scheduling seems to be appreciated :-)

* Github workflow (CI) +2

Unexpected that this would be appreciated
that much: it is a Programming Formalisms
course, so this would seem to be on the
more practical side of things.

* cats +4
* Windows XP background -1

Those cheeky students with their
funky jokes :-)

## What held us back?

* Lars rushed through the last parts of his lectures
* (Still) too many lectures -- Zoom fatigue
* Presentations
* Balance between lectures and exercises.
* Too low tempo, especially in the lectures. +1

I feel this is not me: I feel that in my
part the balance between lecturing
and exercises is good. I will ignore.

* Some exercises could be explained better. We spent a lot of time just
  discussing what we were supposed to do. +1
* Unclear desciption and explanation of exercises +5

I am one of the offenders here and I agree.

* Skipping over content throughout the course; it gets confusing

I think this is not me, as I have skipped
nothing; I am most ruthless in cutting
content. Will ignore.

* might be helpful to do the git stuff all together

Agreed, I suggest that too :-)

* Some parts of the pair programming seems not needed

Unsure what this is about ... too bad :-|

* less reading documents after Wed.

Agreed, I was focusing on exercises and
catching up. More time with course materials
will improve this next time.

* Different levels of preparation, everyone does not fulfill course
  prerequisites or preparations from last friday

I think working always in pairs from the
first day will help everyone get to speed
quickly.

* too manny cats -6
* too often told to not point fingers :finger_gun:

Haha :-)

## What can we improve?

* The coures was 'top-heavy'. The beginning (in my opinion) should be more
  interactive and with more utilities, like git, being taught.
  After the first day, then you can bring in more and more theory.

Agreed.

* More focus on a project to try out all the things taught in the course.
  Design -> Tests -> Implementation -> Iterations

This is very close The Dream!

* If exercises or examples are related with published papers

Unsure if this is on me: I do have links
to the literature.

* Personally, I felt that the course was held at too low level.
  I was expecting more details and technical discussion, especially
  in the algorithm and data structure sections and I was familiar with most
  of the course content. In the future I would suggest that you should make
  it more clear what level of material to expect. +1 (but in the opposite
  direction - found a lot was very technical)

I'd agree we could have gone deeper. I have
the idea it can be done, for example, would
Day 3 not be a catching-up day, I would have
gone deeper. OTOH, even then time was short.

* If there is an opportunity giving small group project and make presentation
  at the final day

I like this alternative idea, yet I do
feel having a shared project helps
feel social coding.

* The course website should be keep maintaining
* provide the correct/complete presentation PDFs on GitHub

I agree and think this is a detail: we
do maintain the course website. The only thing
not done by me is to update the PDFs of the
slides. Yes, we should provide these. I chose
not to update these, as my lessons have
exercises that practice the theory.

* No need to attempt completeness, one week is not enough -- material on top
  of what is discussed in documentation on GitHub -- more exercises,
  less lectures

Agreed!

* I think when it is online, the course is limited in several certain ways.
  MAybe consider on-site class?

Impossible.

* it would be nice to survey attendees beforehand for their favourite languages
  and experience with specific parts of the course - e.g some are gitmasters,
  some have never used git before and found it confusing
  af - and tailor classes appropriately

More pairs would help this. AFAIK, we already
survey skills of the learners...?

* Show more "good" github repos

Interesting, may do.

* More examples of how these things are practiced in an academic setting

Yup, maybe a preregistered study would be
better?

* more on design of larger program projects

Would be nice, not in my hands.

* if possible, work only on example project (no planets,no bacteria)

Unsure. Agreed to have few repos.

* üê±üê±üê± more cats üê±üê±üê± +2
* additional animals +3
* Additional materials
* more dogs :dog2:

Haha!

My final thoughts:
I am happy the learners and I are on the
same page. I will help convey the ideas
of this cohort to the next :+1:
