## Course as a whole



## Commits of teachers

I was interested in the commits: who of us committed when?

I see that some of us work outside of working hours
and in the weekends. Maybe this puts too much stress on us?

On the other hand: I am super happy with working at my weirder hours :-)

## Commits of learners

I was interested in the commits: who of us committed when?

I am happy to see no learners worked in the weekend
and most commit under course hours :-)

## To discuss at a meeting

If a coordinator does not have the proper time to do his/her job,
consider reducing the amount of teaching hours for that
teacher, so he/she has the time to do so.

If a teacher does not have the proper time to prepare,
consider reducing the amount of teaching hours for that
teacher, so he/she has the time to focus on those fewer hours.

I think all of us should follow the NBIS 'Train the Trainer' course,
as I think some more knowledge on teaching would help us prepare our lessons
better.

If a teacher does not read the evaluation results,
lets not bother the learners by asking those questions.

As we do not actually work on a project,
I suggest to remove pretending to do so
or add more time for this.
In any case, I do think we should keep working on a shared repository.

As we do not use issues in practice,
I suggest to remove the session on issues.

As we do not use the kanban board in practice,
I suggest to remove the session on kanban board.

As we do not use the risk assessment in practice,
I suggest to remove that section.

As we do not use the requirements document in practice,
I suggest to remove that section.

As our learners are academics,
I suggest to replace a requirements document
by a draft paper.

As we do not apply the content of 'Modularity' in practice,
I suggest to remove this session.

As I think there is too big of a gap between the content of 'Object oriented
development' and all other lectures, I suggest to rewrite or remove it.

As I think there should be enough time for function design,
I suggest to remove all sessions on OOP, unless functions can be
discussed properly.
