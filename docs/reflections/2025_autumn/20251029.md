- Day 5
- Author: Richel

I am happy with how the morning went.
I let the learners work individually and I think that went fine:
it gave me the time to have multiple more in-depth 1-on-1 discussions.

In the first session, there was an unexpected problem
with uploading the package
to PyPI, I will need to check for the next time.

- [ ] Update the session on creating a package

In the first session, I could have gone a bit more in-depth,
although I do feel it was the most efficient use of time:
I feel the duration of the session was good

The second session went fine I think,
although I could have easily spent more time on its discussion.
Although, also here, I do feel it was the most efficient use of time:
I feel the duration of the session was good

At the end of my last session, I thanked the learners.
This felt good to do.

As I did so yesterday with Lars,
I decided to make an activity diagram too:
