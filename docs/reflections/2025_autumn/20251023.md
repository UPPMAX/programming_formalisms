I enjoyed working with our learners and have been
able to talk one-on-one-ish with 6 out of 7
learners.

I do not like it when we break our own promises:
it makes my team look needlessly unreliable.
Examples:

- If the email states we start at 9:00 sharp,
  I think we should not start at 9:02
- If the schedule states a break at a certain time,
  I think we should not start a 
  new thread of discussion at that time
- We decided to use VSCode instead of the terminal,
  I think we should not discuss the terminal commands
- We decided no homework.
  I think we should not ask our learners
  to read course material in the evening

I do not like it when we talk instead of teach:
it makes my team look needlessly long-winded.
Instead, when we use a simplified definition
of teaching, such as 'teaching is talking and
monitoring the progress of our learners',
it would help all of us to be more effective
teachers.
