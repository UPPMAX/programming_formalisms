- I wonder why we break our own promises? It makes us look needlessly
  unreliable. Examples:
  - If the email states we start at 9:00 sharp,
    why do we start at 9:02 in practice? 
  - If a break starts at 9:50, why do start a new thread of discussion
    at 9:49? Same at 10:55
  - If we state to use VSCode instead of the terminal,
    why show the terminal commands?
- I wonder why do we sometimes talk instead of teach?
  Teaching is talking and (e.g. with an exercise)
  monitoring the progress of our learners

As far as I can see, this would be my favorite grouping:

- know the basics well enough to move on: Cibi, Lorena, Carlos, Gabriel
- a refresher on this seems useful: Alice, Anna-Lena, Hyewon

Sure, I can be wrong: this is all Google and GitHub and talking/observing with/of you gave me :-) .
