- Day 3

I added a session, called 'TDD at a larger scale',
as this was implicitly requested by the learners.
On the one hand, this takes away time from other sessions,
yet on the other hand, it shows that I listen to the learners.
Let's see if there is anything about this in the Retrospect.

I am unsure about the form of the first hour, 'TDD at a larger scale'.
It was more talking than I am used to, although I did
interacted with the learners after each couple of minutes.
Let's see what they say on the Retrospect.

For pair programming, I was happy to use a learner as a volunteer:
it is most fun and insightful.

I enjoyed working with the group. I've paired them up in a way that
would allow everyone to thrive. I have some ideas for tomorrow too:
it would be nice to mix them up :-)

I broke my rule of breaks at the scheduled point in time:
instead, I had
both of my breaks earlier. I feel moving breaks to earlier is fine,
where I feel moving breaks to later is not. 
I think this is fine.
