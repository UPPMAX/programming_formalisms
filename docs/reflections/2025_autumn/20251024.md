- Day 2
- Author: Richel

I think we do not do object-oriented programming, yet I heard
it both today and yesterday. Checking the meeting notes, I see no decision
on this. On the other hand, I do not have time for doing OOP in my
sessions. I suggest to reduce the mentioning of OOP.

For the rest of the day, in my part, I tried out breakout rooms of
1 person. I felt uncomfortable doing so, as I worried the learners would
feel alone. But after some visits, the learners seemed to be fine with
it. There was plenty of opportunity to have a bit longer talks with learners.

During the day, I never rushed, even though there was more on the schedule,
which felt the right choice.
