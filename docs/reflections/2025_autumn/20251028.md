- Day 4
- Author: Richel

I decided to change the lesson plan and at the start
send this in the Zoom chat:

- [ ] Go over the reflection at <https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/reflections/2025_autumn/20251027/>
- [ ] Add an extra session with group exercises
  Do so by starting with continuous integration.
  Here they can learn how to write clean enough code
- [ ] After CI, do testing framework
- [ ] After that, continue with regular schedule
- [ ] Clarify how to work with messy data

The first two hours were spend on CI.
I think that was a good idea as I feel that the learners now
know how to write code that is Good Enough.
I had prepared 3 groups of 2 for the CI exercises, however,
one learner was absent, which resulted in 1 group of 3.
I was unhappy about this imbalance. However, the group seemed
to work quite well and when I offered to do 1-on-1 with a volunteer learner,
this offer was rejected.

In the third hour, Lars taught about object-oriented design. It was
unfortunate in some ways, as Lars assumed I would have taught class
design already. Also, his session started 15 minutes later, as I was
unaware of this irregularity in the schedule.

After his teaching, me and Lars discussed this. I said sorry to Lars for
taking 15 minutes too mucg :-) .
We decided to switch things
around, with me teaching 'Class design' for one hour, after which he
has the remaining time. I am happy how we dealt with this.

The fourth hour (i.e. the first after lunch) I had my last session and
here we were with 6 learners. I made the dream groups I had prepared.
And it seemed to work out perfectly! At around 13:40, 2 out of 3 groups
had written a class, where the remaining group had a wonderful dynamics
that I did not want to disturb. I collected the 2 groups that were done
in 1 room, where I discussed code coverage. It was a bit rushed, but I
felt it was worth it.

It has its pros and cons to actually listen to the learners. On the other
hands, I do feel I picked the right things: that what I chose to skip
is -I feel- less important.

## Observation Lars

I decided to make an activity diagram:
