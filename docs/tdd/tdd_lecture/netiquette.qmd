## Netiquette

![](programming_formalism_course.png)

## Why a netiquette?

Because it helps you learn and us teach effectively.

## We just need to know

Let us know

-   ... when you cannot be there
-   ... when you cannot use a camera
-   ... when you cannot use a microphone

No need to give a reason, we trust our students!

## We will be interactive

We should \[1-5\]:

-   Turn on your camera
-   You should/can/will be asked questions :-)

E.g., from \[1\]:

> Evidence shows that instructors need to maintain substantial involvement in online courses \[2,3\]

## You should be interactive

You are strongly encouraged to:

-   Ask for clarification
-   Criticise the reasoning

## Recommendations

-   Remove all distractions
    -   Phone
    -   Programs/websites with popups
-   Take a (boring!) break
    -   There will always be a break after 45 minutes
