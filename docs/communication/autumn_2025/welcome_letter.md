Hi and welcome to the Programming formalisms course!

We are getting ready for the course which starts on `[MONTH] [STARTDATE]` and is online.

The course and all materials relevant to the course are available on GitHub for reuse. There will be a course project which is also on GitHub. The use of git and tools like it are a valuable part of the toolkit of a professional developer and the use of these tools in the course is an active choice as part of the learning experience.

Course material: <https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/>
Course repo: <https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/>
Project repo: <https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_[XXX>]

Make sure you have followed the <https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/prereqs/> so that you are set up to start the course.

We will meet you at the zoom :
`https://uu-se.zoom.us/j/NNNNNNNN`
with Passcode: `NN_NN`

We always start sharp at 09.00 and the zoom is always open 30 min before the course starts. If you feel like, hanging out or have questions feel free to show up early.

Looking forward to see you at the course,
Best regards from the course team
Lars, Richèl and Björn
