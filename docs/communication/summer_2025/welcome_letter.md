- Email title: Programming Formalisms course letter

Hi and welcome to Programming Formalisms,
we are getting ready for the course which starts on 5th of May and is online,
the course page https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/
The course and all materials relevant to the course are availible on GitHub
for reuse there will be a course project which is also GitHub.
The use of `git` and tools like it are a valuble part of the toolkit
of a professional developer and the use of these tools in the course
is an active choice as part of the learning experience.

Check the following prereqs before we start on the first course day:
