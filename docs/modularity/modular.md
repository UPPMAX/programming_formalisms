    Modular programming as a term introduced by Larry Constantine et.al at the Symposium on Modular Programming, organized at the Information and Systems Institute in July 1968.
    
    Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.
