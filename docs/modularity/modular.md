# Modular programming
!!! "Learning goals"

    Todays Learning Goals are:
    ???- info "Learning objectives of 'Modular programming'"

        - The student has a introductory understanding to the modular programming paradigm and the concept of iterative refactoring of code. 
        - The concepts of common interface and protocols are introduced
        -The students are introduced the concept of coupling and how to find tight coupling
        - Learns the importance of modularisation when collaborating on larger projects by example of the reduced number of conflicts of commits.
        - The students partitions their design and message passing by refactoring design and implementation according to the modular paradigms for the student project
   
   ???- info "Learning objectives of 'Design Patterns'"
    
        -The students know of the "zero line" code and how it relates to software design "Zero line" Design
        - The students should be able to implement into their design the 
        "Factory pattern"
        -The students can describe the general parts of a design pattern and why we use them.


##Prior Knowledge:
???- "What is Modular Programming"

    Modular programming as a term introduced by Larry Constantine et.al at the Symposium on Modular Programming, organized at the Information and Systems Institute in July 1968.
    
    Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.
