Open Issue                                                  |Assigned|Progress
------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------
<https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/16>|L       |WIP

5 Issues were closed.

- Björn: 
    - Made all required installations on Windows and Mac and rewrote prerequirements (took whole day last Friday)
    - started with some goals and planning for which files to start from
- Richel:
    - add all learning objectives to my pages
    - convert some Quarto lecture slides to markdown

Discuss:

- [Björn -> Richel] Can someone check the prereqs for Linux? Richel does that!
- [Björn for Lars] Please check <https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/introductions/sdlc_tools/#software-citation>
- [Richel, 5 mins] I am happy to see learning objectives on our pages, as this helps one focus on how/what to teach! Learning objectives, however, should be learner-centered, active, observable and specific, e.g. 'learners are able to do a git push', instead of vague 'We will get some theory of X'. Could we try to make all teaching objectives learner-centered, active, observable and specific? I volunteer to do Pull Requests :-)
    - [VOTED] BLR: Yes
    - [other votes] : No
- [Richel, 5 mins] I am happy to see the prereqs page and the obvious love put in it. I am unsure of the page's purpose. Could we come up with a purpose of the page and vote? As Björn will the one teaching the first sessions, however, I agree he is boss on this. Also, I volunteer to do the work. If we discuss: The goal of the prereqs page is ...
    - [VOTED] BLR: that our learners can verify that they have installed the minimum requirements for the course
    - [other votes]: [other suggestions]
- [Richel, 5 mins] I think it is useful that we do anonymous evaluations. However, when analyzing the evaluations, most questions are useless to me. Which questions are useful to the others? Below is my dream evaluation:
    - Lars: we **must** follow the NBIS parts. 
    - [TODO] Next next meeting: we all put our dream evaluation here before next meeting

```
- What should we keep doing?
- What should we improve?
- Other comments?
```

- [Richel, 5 mins] I enjoy how we all try to improve on the course. However, having too few time for exercises seems to be a running theme, although we seem to have the will to improve this. Here I suggest something to help us commit: making it an explicit retrospect and evaluation question. Dare we commit to this?
    - [VOTED] BLR: Yes
    - [other votes]: No


Retrospect example:

```
## Which section(s) scheduled enough time for exercises? <--- SUGGESTED
```

Evaluation example:

```
- Which section(s) scheduled enough time for exercises? <--- SUGGESTED
```


Future schedule:

- Week 13: learning objectives on pages [will rework a bit]
- Week 14: start of draft of exercises in place [Björn away]
- Week 15: draft of material in place
- Week 16: improve
- Week 17: teaching

## Meeting Wednesday 20 March 11:00-12:00

- [Richel, vote] move all schedules from HackMD to website. To see how that looks like, I put a copy at [the course website](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/intro/)
    - [VOTED!] pro: proper version control, no duplicates that can differ
    - con: ?
    - votes: pro: BLR, con: .

    - con: can mismatch
    - votes: pro: BLR, con: .
- [Richel, discuss] I'd enjoy a long-term schedule for preparation:, e.g.
    - Week 13: learning objectives on pages, e.g <[Learning objectives](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/pair_programming/)>
    - Week 14: draft of exercises in place [Björn away]

        - Can we move something from the last days here?
        - (Data structures)


## Meeting 2024-02-28 11.00
- Discuss
    - structure of mkdocs **web** tree
        1. daily in upper menus :+1::+1:
            - pro: very clear for students during course
        3. topics in upper menu
            - pro: clear after course 


    - structure in mkdocs **file** tree
        1. daily directories
            - pro: simple
        3. topic directories :+1:
            - pros: 
                - easier to rearrange later 
                - just move existing directories, almost...
    - reading with topics in sub menus :+1::+1:
    - extra reading with topics in sub menus :+1::+1:

- Teaching
    - **mkdocs website with lesson structure** which is very easy to follow for students that are missing parts.
    - slides and movies:
      - **if teacher wants to use them**, but has to be linked to from the md lesson material

- Responsibilites
    - all are responsible in populating the docs with their md material
    - Björn starts to make some more structure of https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/

## Meeting 2024-02-21 

- [Richel, 5 mins] Discuss the word 'theoretical': 
  - the content of the course can be as practical or theoretical as Lars wants it to be. I have no problem with content being about theory.
  - teaching time consists out of lecturing and exercises. Here I misused the terms 'theoretical' for 'lecturing' and 'practical' for 'exercises'. Here we know that whatever the content is, there must be exercises, see among others [Bell, 2020] for an evidence-based 5 step model (1. Prior knowledge, 2. Present, 3. Challenge, 4. Feedback, 5. Repeat), that overlaps with [Hattie, 2008].
      - We agree :-)
- [Richel, 5 mins] The course goals use 'understand' a lot. This is commonly mapped to the one-but-lowest level in Bloom's taxonomy (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy#Cognitive_domain_(knowledge-based), see 'Comprehension')(pretty picture: https://www.alfaandfriends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/revised-blooms-taxonomy.jpg). Is this word really properly chosen? If not, could we use the right verbs? I feel we do aim at higher levels, but maybe I should change my teaching. In any case: how do we test for this level being achieved (spoiler: exercises)? 
    - We tend to drift to the Apply level, yet also sometimes to Design. Some of us try to be more precise in writing down teaching goals.
    - We (intend to) teach at the Apply level and if there is more time, we go up higher
- [VOTED] Vote for using MkDocs
- [Björn, 20m] Discuss schedule below
    - Examples: 
        - If two teacher on one day, we all agree to mix up the day itself
        - Merging Wed somehow: yes, will work!
        - shortening Thu if possible?: done!
        - shortening Fri if possible: done!
        - this is to fit with wrapping-up of project: done!

- ToDos:
    - We are basically two teachers per day. Let's plan for 2-person meetings!
    - Björn
    - Lars
    - Richèl
 
 
### Schedule

- Remember: The initial aims for the course
  - give scientists with some experience in programming and scripting:
    - an **understanding** of the **underlying principles** of software development, design, and programming.
  - strengthen the **understanding** of:
    - more **advanced programming concept**s
    - **ability to produce** more reusable scripts through modular programming
    - enable a better **understanding** of how to evaluate a script or programs **performance**.
  - encourage the **use of software development tools**, like:
    - Unified Model Language
    - Git and Github
  - convince the benefits of **sharing and social coding**

- So... practicals are very important but also the theory of whats and whys

 * We work together on a example project, so the students have one good example how it should be done.
 * [R, 17 mins total] R: suggest one/two project topics (1 for students, maybe 1 for teachers)
     * [10 mins, collect] All suggest the topics for a general project individually, in silence [R asked in Slack to do this before meeting]

#### TODOs 
 
  * [x] M and R will down more detailed exact description about their projects and send to L
      * [x] M: The program should visually display a number of particles on a field. Particles are initialised with a certain position and speed. Each particle interacts with all the other particles in a simple way, e.g. gravitational attraction, Lennard-Jones potential, direction alignment (implementing a flocking behaviour), or something else, the group chooses which. Decide on a boundary condition (e.g. bounce or wrap or eliminate the particle). The simulation is then stepped forward, drawing each step, until stopped. The goal is to create a stable simulation capable of the maximum number of particles at an acceptable framerate.

### Björn's questions for Intro day
- UML seems to require that I talk about Object orientation as well
  - How much?
  - I will cover it in detail during the Paradigm as it is very important to understand the concepts of object orientation inorder to grasp modern modularisation in my oppinion.
  - What do you cover in your lesson, Lars?
  [x] class+sequence+ aktivitetsdiagram
  [x] plantUML

Programming Formalism Course - October 24-28 (online)

This full 5-day course aims to give life scientists, bioinformaticians, and other scientists with some experience in programming and scripting an understanding of the underlying principles of software development, design, and programming. The course aims to strengthen the understanding of more advanced programming concepts, ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular programming and to enable a better understanding of how to evaluate a script or programs performance.

We will cover an introduction to Algorithms and Data structures, Programming Paradigms especially structured and object oriented programming, and to give an overview of other paradigms like functional programming. Modular development and (code) reusability, testing and optimisation.

We will cover theory with bridging practical examples and applications to enhance the theoretical understanding of the principles.
