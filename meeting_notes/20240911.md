# Meeting notes 2024-09-11

- R: [#52](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/52). 
  The course content seems a bit scattered, as I cannot
  conclude a rule that is used to yes/no discuss a topic.
  I think it would be good to have a clear rule behind our course
  material what should and what should not be discussed at this course.
  I hope we can suggest some rules and then vote for our favorite.
  - R: Only what is used by the student project is course content.
    The student project is a piece of maintainable and tested Python code.
- R: if possible, vote for a rule
- R: [#45](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/45)
  We discussed reordering the course material and that everyone would
  come up with a suggestion. What is the progress for everybody in this?
  - R: my ideas are in 
    [my reflections of the last course iteration](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/tree/main/reflections/2024_summer).
    Biggest change: learning the basic tools, i.e. `git` at day 1, so we can 
    then focus on theory. Maybe make next week a deadline for this?
- R: can we convert the slides to website pages (or can they be deleted?)
  It will make the GitHub repo less messy.
  I volunteer to do this and/or help with this
- R: what do we think about giving advice (e.g. 'Always do X') without
  a reference to the literature?
  - R: I think most of our advice should be backed up by a reference to
    the literature, to prevent teaching what we do, but teach what one
    should do instead
