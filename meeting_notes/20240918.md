- R: How do we think a meeting should look like?
  What do we think are good and bad practices?
  How to make sure it is effective?
  - R: question 1: do we think these can be improved?
    - R: yes
  - R: question 2: if yes, how?
    - R: (1) specify the goal of our meeting, e.g. 'To make decisions
      on the course content and practicalities'. 
      (2) only discuss items that are written down in advance,
      (3) short is better: move complex topics to next week, fun anecdotes
      are discouraged, chairman should be ruthless

  - R: if there are suggestions, decide next week
