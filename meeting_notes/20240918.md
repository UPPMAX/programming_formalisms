## Evaluation notes

These are the notes from [earlier meeting](20240911.md):

- General
  - B: breaks should be for breaks
    - R: agrees
  - B: learners don't read instructions in breaks
    - R: agrees
- Monday 
  - B: We don't have workflows in the course yet. 
    - R: agrees somewhat, the GitHub workflow could be discussed more explicity
    - B: We often discuss what to put in yes/no and we feel now the other topics are even more important
- Wednesday
  - B: Switching between VS-code and github caused some trouble in updating the
    branches on the terminal, causing some confusion in merging branches (solving conflicts)
    - B: This is a technical issue we cannot help. 
    - R: I suggest to use GitHub interface as much as possible and
       not to use `git -b` nor the VS code git plugin to simplify things
  - B: We hope there is enough time to fix the expected unexpected problems.
    - BC just learned that sync between GH and VS code should be easy,
      not needing ssh-keys,share in prereqs?
    - R: I hope the SSH keys are removed entirely, as it is only a nice-to-have, not a must
- B: Switching between users in pair-programming takes time. So maybe more time might be needed.
  - B: Agreed that this takes time. We hope there is enough time to do so.
  - R: Agreed. I think pair should be created only in the morning and in the afternoon,
    as a compromise
- B: questions:
    - B: define discussion
        - student discussion?
          - R: when students talk more than 50% of the time,
            i.e. the teacher talks less than 50%
        - lesson material just covered in material and talk
          - R: there is feedback on the exercises made
