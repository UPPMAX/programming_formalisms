# Meeting notes 2024-09-25

- R: How do we think a meeting should look like?
  What do we think are good and bad practices?
  How to make sure it is effective?
  - R: question 1: do we think these can be improved?
    - R: yes
  - R: question 2: if yes, how?
    - R: (1) specify the goal of our meeting, e.g. 'To make decisions
      on the course content and practicalities'. 
      (2) only discuss items that are written down in advance,
      (3) short is better: move complex topics to next week, fun anecdotes
      are discouraged, chairman should be ruthless
      (4) write these rules down and follow them
  - R: if there are suggestions, decide next week
- R: NBIS wants all its courses to use a Short-Term Feedback form.
  I converted this to markdown and put it at
  [https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/blob/main/docs/misc/evaluation.md](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/blob/main/docs/misc/evaluation.md).
  What do we think about this form?
  - R: I think its goal 'to find out how participants have used the skills and
    knowledge they gained through participating in the NBIS course' is
    irrelevant and the survey asks way more than just achieving that goal.
    Due to its vague, irrelevant goal and its many nice-to-have questions,
    I think it is way too extensive and we should not bother our learners with
    it. The only questions I'd keep is '7. Would you recommend the course?',
    '8. What is your overall rating for the course?' and 'Any other comments?'
- R: [#56](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/56)
  can we convert the slides to website pages (or can they be deleted?)
  It will make the GitHub repo less messy.
  I volunteer to do this and/or help with this
- R: [#57](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/57)
  what do we think about giving advice (e.g. 'Always do X') without
  a reference to the literature?
  - R: I think most of our advice should be backed up by a reference to
    the literature, to prevent teaching what we do, but teach what one
    should do instead
