# Meeting 2024-11-29

Goal: to determine what needs to be discussed in future meetings.
If we know what to do, we can agree on doing those things.

- R: suggest: for next time, we should have all gone through the issues
  and gave our opinions
- R: suggest: what about we schedule a day/half-day to work on the course?
