# 2024-10-29 with NBIS Training Hub

- Goal: to find out how the NBIS Training Hub can help us improve our course

Recommendations, first follow ([link](https://training.scilifelab.se/our_resources/trainer_community)):

- Train the Trainer
- Organisational learning course
- The Swedish context of Open Sciece

Advice:

- All team members should try to do a reflection
- Try to build in peer observation within team
- Contact former students informally to see which part of the curriculum was most important to them
  - R: Why, besides being interesting?
    - Because it may help shape the course curriculum
    - R: Unsure about that: we pick what we need to discuss.
- Individually schedule a meeting with the NBIS Training Hub
