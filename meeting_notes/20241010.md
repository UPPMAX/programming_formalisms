# Meeting notes 2024-10-10

- [#51](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/issues/51)
  Discuss the NBIS survey per point, at 
  [https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/blob/main/docs/misc/evaluation.md](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms/blob/main/docs/misc/evaluation.md)
  (note the final version will be a regular Google Form).
  What do we think about this?
  - R: I think its goal 'to find out how participants have used the skills and
    knowledge they gained through participating in the NBIS course' is
    irrelevant and the survey asks way more than just achieving that goal.
    Due to its vague, irrelevant goal and its many nice-to-have questions,
    I think it is way too extensive and we should not bother our learners with
    it. 
    The only question I'd keep is 'Any other comments?', but I'd agree on using
    '7. Would you recommend the course?' and
    '8. What is your overall rating for the course?' too.
  - B: If NBIS wants it, can we say no?
      - But sure, most questions can be included in a web form after course.
      - I think all questions should be covered at least somewhere.

- Evaluation procedure: Do and how do we enjoy evaluation and feedback?
  - Use a daily retrospect yes/no
  - Use the unmodified NBIS survey at the end yes/no
  - Use a modified NBIS survey at the end yes/no
  - Use a place for anonymous feedback yes/no (see below for screenshot)
  - Use a daily confidence report (see below for screenshot) yes/no

- R: go through the Issues
- R: we have no Retrospects scheduled. I feel no need to, because I am
  not Jon. Do we remove Retrospects (and maybe replace these)?
  If yes, who does them?
  - Remove retrospects: R
  - Keep retrospects:

- R: I miss having a video of lectures I teach for own private usage,
  such as making activity diagrams (see below)
  I can do a screen recording from my own computer and keep it someplace
  private. How to do this responsibly?

- R: in all iterations of the course, we lost a substantial amount of learners.
  Below is a plot of last course's iteration.
  In the evaluations it was noted 'The course was top-heavy' (quote
  below, source at [../../shared_documents/2023_autumn/day_5.md](../../shared_documents/2023_autumn/day_5.md)).
  What will we do if we loose that many learners coming iterations too?

> The beginning (in my opinion) should be more interactive and with more

> After the first day, then you can bring in more and more theory.
